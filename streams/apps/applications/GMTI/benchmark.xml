GMTI(Ground Moving Target Indicator) Application, or more properly phases two 
through six out out of the seven phases of the application.  The first phase
is separated out as the TDE benchmark, the last phase  was not written sine it 
required dynamic rates, which were not available at the time.

This is a proof-of-concept implementation: the DFT is slow, and the input 
parameter sizes have been cut down from the original.  

For more inforation see readme.txt.
