Here's how to take the output of RayTracer_works and conver to a PPM
file (viewable with XV).

Do, for example,

java RayTracer_works -i 1024 > out.ppm

Then replace the FOO at the beggining with this text:

----
P6
32 32
255

----

(Do not include the ---.  They are used above to indicate that a blank
line needs to come between 255 and the data.)

These lines mean:

P6 - Version 6 of PPM (?)
32 32 - size of the grid
255 - number of colors
