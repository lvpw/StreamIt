Specific Problems With the New-Syntax FAT Implementation

-- WideBand is a splitjoin with N_sub BandProc children.  The output
   type of BandProc is complex[N_dop][N_rg/N_dn][N_dop], but the
   output type of WideBand is complex[N_dop][N_rg][N_dop].  This works
   only if N_dn exactly equals N_sub, which the comment in
   FAT-test.str suggests should be the case; a unification step still
   needs to happen.

-- AdapBeam is a *BIG HONKING FILTER*.  It also does
   N_bm*N_srg*N_pri+N_bm+1 pushes, where its declared push rate is 1.
   ("Something's wrong with its pushing.")  Looking at what Block45
   does, though, this is actually correct (save the +1), the I/O rate
   and push at the end just need to be fixed.

-- FFTVect depends on (presumably our stock) FFT2, which doesn't exist
   here.

-- STAP is only a moderately big quacking filter.  But it also calls
   the LQ pipe, which might want to become a filter.
