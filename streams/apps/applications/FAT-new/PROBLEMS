Specific Problems With the New-Syntax FAT Implementation
$Id: PROBLEMS,v 1.3 2008-11-08 14:04:03 thies Exp $

-- ../FAT/LQ.java and ../FAT/Comp.java need to be integrated here as
   static helper functions.  Search for "TODO" in source code.

-- there are many type-mismatches between communicating filters, all
   of which probably are due to array sizes.  Unclear if error is in
   program or in compiler.  (Can skip these semantic checks by
   commenting out a few lines of frontend, if you'd like to see stream
   graph generated from library.)

-- The compiler will need to support constant prop of complex numbers
   before this goes through.

-- DownSamp filter declares pop>0 but does not call pop()

-- AdapBeam does N_bm*N_srg*N_pri+N_bm+1 pushes, where its declared
   push rate is 1.  ("Something's wrong with its pushing.")  Looking
   at what Block45 does, though, this is actually correct (save the
   +1), the I/O rate and push at the end just need to be fixed.
