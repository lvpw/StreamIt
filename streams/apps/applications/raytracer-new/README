This is a Raytracer implementation from Intel with 
modifications by Janis Sermulins.

The Raytracer.str is identical in the library and the 
cluster version except that for the library the output 
dimensions are 40*40 but for the cluster 640*640.

To execute library version type:

	strc --library -i 1600 Raytracer.str

To execute cluster version type:

	strc --cluster 1 Raytracer.str
	make -f Makefile.cluster
	// modify cluster-config.txt
	./run_cluster -i 409600
