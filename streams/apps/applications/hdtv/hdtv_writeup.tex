\section{Introduction/Overview}

This article presents a partial implementation in StreamIT of the HDTV standard 
for transmitting digital television signals as described in 
ASTC Standard A53\cite{atsc:a53b}. 

\subsection{StreamIT}
StreamII is a novel language for representing streaming applications. Streaming applications 
are applications that operate on a (potentially) infinite amount of data. Examples of 
streaming applications include media processing (audio, video), digital communicaton
(cell phones, wireless networking), digital signal processing, and any other 
application that needs to operate on a large amount of streaming data.

The system model for HDTV is 
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hdtv-system}. The A53 standard describes
the service multiplex and transport, otherwise known as the channel coding.
ATSC Standard A52\cite{atsc:a52a} specifies the audio coding and the ISO  
standard for MEPG-2\cite{iso:13818-1}\cite{iso:13818-2} specifies the video coding.

Since StreamIT is currently limited to static rate applications (the rate that data 
moves through the system can not be data dependent), compression schemes (like MPEG-2)
can not currently be implemented. Therefore, we will focus our attention in this paper on
a partial implementation of the HDTV channel coder and decoder. 

HDTV lies squarely in the domain of communication theory, which a typical programmer does
not have an indepth knowledge of. Since there seemed to be a dearth of explanations and tutorials
on the web that explain not only the HDTV system in terms of atomic communication systems
building blocks but also expalins those building blocks. 

Figure~\ref{hdtv-pipeline} shows the internal structure of the HDTV channel coder, and 
internal structure of the decoder on the left and right respectively. We did not 
have any input/output traces to work with, we had to implement the encoder pieces as well so 
that we could verify that our decoder worked.
