/**
 * The Data reorder takes the data bound for the symbol mapper
 * (eg so it is in bits) and reorders it based on what data segment type
 * we are currently processing. There are three data segment types:0,1,2.
 *
 * Data segment 1 is type 0, segment 2 is type 1, segment 3 is type 2
 * segment 4 is type 0, etc.
 *
 * The interleaver works based based on 12 bytes worth of data (unfortunately
 * they are bits at this point in the pipeline)
 *
 * Basically, the 12 bytes come in like this:
 * [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]
 *
 * with type 0 they leave like this:
 * [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]
 * with type 1 they leave like this:
 * [4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 0 1 2 3]
 * with type 1 they leave like this:
 * [8 9 10 11 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
 *
 *
 * To un reorder the data, the segment stuff works slightly differetly
 * Basically, the 12 bytes come in like this:
 * [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]
 *
 * with type 0 they leave like this:
 * [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11]
 * with type 1 they leave like this:
 * [8 9 10 11 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
 * with type 1 they leave like this:
 * [4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 0 1 2 3 ]
