  <desc>Ten-stage lattice filter</desc>
  <description>
Constructs a ten-stage lattice filter.  The first and last stages are
special; otherwise, a series of mostly-identical stages are
constructed in order and fed into a pipeline.  Two items are carried
between each stage of the lattice filter, with the second item delayed
by one element.
