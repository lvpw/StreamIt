Phased filter example

PhaseTest.str contains a minimal program that demonstrates StreamIt's
phased-filter construct.  The core of the program is the IntSelector
phased filter.  There are two phases in this filter.  The first phase
reads (count) items off of the input tape and stores them.  The second
phase, which is run (count) times, reads an item off the input tape
and returns the corresponding item out of the store.  Thus, with count=4:

               1 3 2 2 8 4 2 1 ---> IntSelector --->

  readValues:          1 3 2 2 ---> IntSelector --->
                                      1 2 4 8

   copyValue:            1 3 2 ---> IntSelector ---> 4
   copyValue:              1 3 ---> IntSelector ---> 4 4
   copyValue:                1 ---> IntSelector ---> 8 4 4
   copyValue:                  ---> IntSelector ---> 2 8 4 4

The source used in the sample code just prints an increasing series of
numbers, grouped in sets of 9, with each set printed in decreasing
order.

As of this writing, this code will run against the StreamIt compiler
but not against the Java library.  In particular, the for loop in the
phased filter's work funciton will not be unrolled in the front-end,
resulting in the compiler being unable to produce an ordered sequence
of phases.
