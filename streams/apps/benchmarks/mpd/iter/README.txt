This is the Median Pulse repetition frequency Doppler radar app  (MPD)

It is described in this tech report:

Programming and Implementation of Streaming Applications. Ola
Johnsson, Magnus Stenemo, and Zain ul-Abdin. Technical Report IDE0405,
Halmstad University, January 2005.

Regarding video.bin (note from Ola):

Regarding this input file, it is really just a file with a lot of numbers in binary form.
To get some real meningful use of it the resulting file should be used to compare with the result.
But if you want to use it for performance comparison it just has to be the right amount
of numbers in the file to run one set of values through the stream.
Because the matlab code belongs to a company we can not give you that.
Though I have some binary files lying around but I do not know which is the correct one
for the implementation that we sent you. The number of cols in the MPD-chain tells which
file to be used. Can you tell me which one you want or maybe all?
