The FIR bank was based on Matlab code implemented by a third party.
The code is part of this benchmark suite on CAG:

/projects/streamit/3rdparty/specs/pca-kernel-benchmarks/

The specific file modeled is

/projects/streamit/3rdparty/specs/pca-kernel-benchmarks/benchmarks/FIR/FirBank.m

The files are not included in the CVS tree since we were asked not to
distribute them.
