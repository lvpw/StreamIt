NOTE: This benchmark was replaced by TDE.  If this is of any interest,
it is because the FIRBank and FIRBankPipeline changed from
column-major to row-major ordering, eliminating the need for a
transpose.  Also, FIRBank has explicit data parallelism.  Finally,
there is matlab reference code for this benchmark (which might also
apply to TDE).  If you ware looking for the most up-to-date and
realistic benchmark, use TDE instead.

*** NOTE *** -- Outputs will not verify unless real coefficients are
used (see program text).

-----------

This code was based off of a Matlab precursor provided by a third
party; see ../matlab for details.

Contents of this directory:

FIRBank.str - Bank of FIR filters from PCA kernel apps.

FIRBankColumn.str - Same as above but assume column-major array layout
		on input and output.  This is probably lower
		performance due to more synchronization in splitjoin.

input.txt - Input for benchmark in text form.

input.dat - Input for benchmark in binary form.  This represents two cycles 
		of the textual input to correspond to a single steady state.

input-columnmajor.txt - Input for benchmark in text form (column-major array layout).

input-columnmajor.dat - Input used by benchmark in binary form (column-major array
		layout).

output.txt - Output of Matlab code (might have different rounding
		than StreamIt code).

output-columnmajor.dat - Same as above in column-major format.
