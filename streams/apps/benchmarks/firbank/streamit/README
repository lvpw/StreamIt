This code was based off of a Matlab precursor provided by a third
party; see ../matlab for details.

Contents of this directory:

FIRBank.str - Bank of FIR filters from PCA kernel apps.

FIRBankRowMajor.str - Same as above but assume row-major array layout
		on input and output.  This allows the computation to be
		expressed naturally as a single pipeline (and no 
		transposes).

input.txt - Input for benchmark in text form (column-major array layout).

input.dat - Input used by benchmark in binary form (column-major array
		layout).  This represents two cycles of the textual input 
		to correspond to a single steady state 

input-rowmajor.dat - Same as above in row-major layout.

output.txt - Output of Matlab code (might have different rounding
		than StreamIt code).

output-rowmajor.dat - Same as above in row-major format.
