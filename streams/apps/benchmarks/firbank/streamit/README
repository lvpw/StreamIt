-----------

This code was based off of a Matlab precursor provided by a third
party; see ../matlab for details.

Contents of this directory:

FIRBank.str - Bank of FIR filters from PCA kernel apps.

FIRBankColumn.str - Same as above but assume column-major array layout
		on input and output.  This is probably lower
		performance due to more synchronization in splitjoin.

input.txt - Input for benchmark in text form.

input.dat - Input for benchmark in binary form.  This represents two cycles 
		of the textual input to correspond to a single steady state.

input-columnmajor.txt - Input for benchmark in text form (column-major array layout).

input-columnmajor.dat - Input used by benchmark in binary form (column-major array
		layout).

output.txt - Output of Matlab code (might have different rounding
		than StreamIt code).

output-columnmajor.dat - Same as above in column-major format.
