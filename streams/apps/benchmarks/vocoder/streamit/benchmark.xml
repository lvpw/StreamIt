  <desc>Vocoder for bitrate reduction in speech</desc>
  <description>
  Application that decodes a .wav file such that speech
  transformations can be smoothly applied to it (pitch, for instance)
  to modify some of its properties without affecting other 
  speech characteristics.  Output is then re-encoded back into the .wav
  format
