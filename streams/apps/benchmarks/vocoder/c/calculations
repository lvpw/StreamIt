Uniprocessor (7/29/2002):
(Xenon 2.2 GHz, 512MB cache)
10,000 iterations (1200 outputs/iteration (each output wave file has 1200 samples)
91.3% utilization
runtime for 10000 iterations = 163.010 seconds

We want cycles/iteration:
10000 iterations/163.010 sec * 
1200 outputs/1 iteration
1 second /2.2x10^9 cycles
* 10^5 cycles 

= 3.3461416 outputs/10^5 cycles
