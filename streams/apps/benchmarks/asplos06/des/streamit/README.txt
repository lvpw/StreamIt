Relative to the version in
$STREAMIT_HOME/apps/benchmarks/des/streamit, it seems this has been
changed in at least the following ways:

- fine-grained Sboxes splitjoin converted to a filter
- number of rounds (evident as pipeline stages) decreased from 16 to 4

There may be other differences? --Bill
