It looks like this version of the benchmark differs from the one in
$STREAMIT_HOME/apps/benchmarks/serpent/streamit in at least the
following ways:

- all "bit" types have been changed to "int" types
- the number of rounds has been decreased from 32 to 8
- filereaders and filewriters in places of sources and sinks
