The FilterBank code is micro04/filterbank/space. This differs from
both filterbank/FilterBankNew.str and from
filterbank/FilterBankLatency.str

The versions differ in the value of the parameter to add FilterBankPipeline at
line 9 (affecting the number of filters) and the value for the number of taps
for BandPassFilter added at line 43 and the BandStopFilter added at line 56
which affect the amout of work done but not the number of filters.
