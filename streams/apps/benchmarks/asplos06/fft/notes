The FFT code is taken from micro04/fft/space.  This looks like a version of
fft/streamit/FFT6 or FFT7 hacked to use reals rather than complex.

The versions FFT1 -- FFT9 differ only in the size of the FFT: from 32 to 4096
resulting in a number of filters of 9, 11, 13, ..., 25.

The output of FFTn.str is sent to FFTn.out, and the output directory contains
library reference output for 100 iterations.
