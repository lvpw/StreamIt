  <desc>Passes a signal through a filter bank</desc>
  <description>
Creates a filter bank to perform multirate signal processing.  The
coefficients for the sets of filters are created in the top-level init
function, and passed down through the init functions to FirFilter
objects.  On each branch, a delay, filter, and downsample is
performed, followed by an upsample, delay, and filter.
