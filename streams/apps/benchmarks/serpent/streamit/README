bTo edit the plain text: modify Source.str
To edit the user key: modify Keys.str
To run: only need to run 1 round of the top level pipeline

To compile: strc Serpent.str L.str Source.str Keys.str Utils.str -o serpent
To run: ./serpent -i1

NOTES:
- the user key belongs in the statics{} section but the compiler
doesn't properly support propagation of contants from global arrays;
hence the user key is defined in the KeySchedule pipeline in Keys.str
- currently the function LRotate in Keys.str implement bit rotation by
mapping an integer to an array of intergers first, then reverse
mapping; this is because the compiler doesn't support operations on
unsigned data types.
