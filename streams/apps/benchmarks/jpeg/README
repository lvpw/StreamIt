To run the JPEG Transcoder, you need a 640x480 JPEG file that uses the
baseline quantization tables. There is a sample image included in input/.

The figure must be converted from from a binary file to an integer binary file
(since the StreamIt file reader reads in integers, each byte of the
binary file is expanded to take up an integer so it can be read properly)

To convert the image file to a compatible format, use the programs
included in the utils/ directory:

1. Compile the b2i.c file (g++ b2i.c -o b2i)
2. Run b2i (./b2i input.jpg input.jpg.int)
3. Run the Transcoder (it expects the input file to be called input.jpg.int)
    It will generate output.jpg.int - make sure that it only runs once
(using -i1 flag to strc) so that it doesn't keep processing the
input file over and over again.
4. Run i2b to convert output.jpg.int to output.bmp (./i2b output.jpg.int output.bmp), output.bmp can be viewed using any image viewer.
