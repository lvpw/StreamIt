  <description>
The JPEG Transcoder takes as input a JPEG image and then decodes it,
specifies a much higher level of JPEG compression, and then re-encodes
it as a JPEG.

Other files: JPEGtoBMP.str produces output.bmp.int,
JPEG.str does not compile   strc -library JPEG.str

Transcoder_Raw.str is a version that prints numbers rather than messaged since
the raw back end does not currently suport printing strings.

      <desc>StreamIt version of JPEG decoder/encoder.
            strc -library Transcoder.str -i1 does not seem to produce complete
            output, but strc -library Transcoder.str -i2 does.  Check sometime
            as to why this is so: it there a fencepost error in the StreamIt
	    code?.
            After testing would want to look at output.jpg.int
	    For some reason, this is included in release testing, but not in
	    the nightly regression test.</desc>
