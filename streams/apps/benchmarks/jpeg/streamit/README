NOTE (Aug. 2005): While JPEG runs in the Java library, we are still in
the process of supporting it in the compiler.  Please contact us if
you are interested in the current status of JPEG and other dynamic

JPEG Benchmark

Author: Matthew Drake (madrake@gmail.com)

The JPEG Benchmark is a work in progress. Right now the Transcoder
part of the benchmark works correctly. It takes as input a JPEG image
and then decodes it, specifies a much higher level of JPEG
compression, and then re-encodes it as a JPEG.

To run the benchmark:
& cd streamit
& make default

(Wait till it tells you that it's finished reencoding the image, then
wait a few seconds for it to finish writing to the file. In the
current version of StreamIt, the use of -nosched requires you to
manually kill the program)

& make outputjpg
The input jpeg is in input/input.jpg
The output jpeg will be in streamit/output.jpg

To run the JPEG Transcoder, you need a 640x480 JPEG file that uses the
baseline quantization tables. The sample image in /input follows this
spec. The c utilities in utils convert it to an integer format
readable within StreamIt.
