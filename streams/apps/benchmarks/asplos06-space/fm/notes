The FMRadio.str code is identical to the code at 
benchmarks/fm/streamit/FMRadio.str

the versions differ in the value of eqBands defined at line 132 (which affects
the number of filters, and the value of numberOfTaps defined at line 125 used 
for the LowPassFilter added at line 152 and the Equalizer added at line 154
which affects the amount of work performed, but not the number of filters.

contains library reference output for 100 iterations.
