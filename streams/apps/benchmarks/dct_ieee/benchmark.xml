  <desc>IEEE-complaint DCT and IDCT.</desc>
  <description>
The dct_ieee package contains functions that implement Discrete Cosine
Transforms and Inverse Discrete Cosine Transforms in accordance with
IEEE specifications for such operations. The IEEE specified DCT is
used in both the MPEG and JPEG standards. A definition of what makes a
DCT or inverse DCT implementation conform to the IEEE specification
can be found in Appendix A of the MPEG-2 specification (ISO/IEC
13818-2) on P. 125.

      <file>DCT.str</file>
      <desc>Contains a library of DCT and iDCT implementations.  There are
      two versions of iDCT: a reference version (based on the C
      reference code for MPEG) and a fast version (an integer iDCT
      that uses bit-twiddling, but does not have the floating point
      precision of the reference codes).  There are also fine-grained
      versions of each implementation, which decompose the problem
      into sub-problems using splitjoins.</desc>
