  <description>
The dct_ieee package contains functions that implement Discrete Cosine
Transforms and Inverse Discrete Cosine Transforms in accordance with
IEEE specifications for such operations. The IEEE specified DCT is
used in both the MPEG and JPEG standards. A definition of what makes a
DCT or inverse DCT implementation conform to the IEEE specification
can be found in Appendix A of the MPEG-2 specification (ISO/IEC
13818-2) on P. 125.

  <implementations>
    <impl lang="StreamIt" dir="streamit" regtest="skip">
      <file>DCTreference.str</file>
      <desc>
      A reference implementation based on the DCT code found within
the C reference MPEG implementation.

    <impl lang="StreamIt" dir="streamit" regtest="skip">
      <file>DCTcomparison.str</file>
      <desc>
Numerically equivalent to the reference
implementation. However, this will run the numbers through both the
reference DCT components and the fast DCT components and report
discrepancies between the two. This version is substantially slower
than either the reference or the fast DCT versions.

    <impl lang="StreamIt" dir="streamit" regtest="skip">
      <file>DCTfast.str</file>
      <desc>
An intuitive StreamIt DCT implementation based on the formula
for the DCT and its natural representation in StreamIt. The
2-Dimensional DCT is broken down into 1-Dimensional DCTs in
perpendicular directions. (Note: It may not actually be faster than
the reference implementation. However, ideally it will be.)
