Note that the Matlab version will die after two iterations due to a
missing file.  We'd have to use the bigger input set (see
../input/README) to have execution progress further.

USING THE MATLAB COMPILER
-------------------------

NOTE: mcc doesn't work here due to the default gcc being 2.95
rather than 3.4.  However, when I compared mcc with plain Matlab on
radish.csail.mit.edu, mcc was ~3x slower.  So the numbers gathered for
Basier's thesis were done under interpreted Matlab from cagfarm-45.

If you want to try mcc, you can go like this:

setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /home/linux/encap/matlab-14sp3/bin/glnx86:/usr/uns/jdk1.5.0_01/jre/lib/i386/client/:/usr/uns/jdk1.5.0_01/jre/lib/i386/:/usr/uns/encap/gcc-3.3.2/lib:/usr/uns/lib

mcc -m clocking testfunc show ransacfitplane ransacfit ransac normalise2dpts harris fundmatrix correlation

./clocking

However, if "clocking" gives you a seg fault, it's because our gcc
paths are messed up (we're pointing to gcc 2.95 rather than gcc3.3).
I had to work this out with Mathworks support.
