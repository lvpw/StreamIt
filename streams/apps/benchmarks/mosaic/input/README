Note that 3.ppm is the same as 1.ppm.  For unusual reasons, the
StreamIt version first tracks from 1.ppm to 2.ppm, then 2.ppm back to
1.ppm, so having 3.ppm in this directory allows the Matlab version to
do the equivalent computation.

An expanded dataset is available on CAG under:

/projects/streamit/compiler-static/mosaic

Note that in that directory, 3.ppm is different than 1.ppm.
