This benchmark represents a subset of the MPEG-2 decoder that can be
processed by the current StreamIt compiler.

This subset lacks the following functionality:
1. Parsing of the MPEG file
2. Motion compensation

The first limitation implies that this benchmark reads in pre-parsed
data for a fixed input file.  If you wish to run on different data,
you can run a fresh MPEG file through the parser using the Java
library.  The parser represents approximately 1/3rd of the computation
in MPEG decoding.

The second limitation implies that only I frames are handled (not P or
B frames).  As most MPEG files have P and B frames, you may need to
manually remove them if processing a new data file.
