DESCRIPTION

This directory contains known outputs, based on certain inputs, 
for running parts of the MPEG decoder and encoder. MD5 checksums 
are also included. This directory should be useful for checking
and verifying the correctness of the compiler on theMPEG decoder
and encoder.

OUTPUTS

Abbreviations:
nm (no message) - refers to output files based on the 
                  messageless test cases. For the decoder
                  the source MPEG-2 input is nomessage.m2v in the
                  input directory.
dec (decoder) - decoder test cases
unver (unverified) - these are output files generated by the compiler
                     to be compared against the CVS copies.

Files:
dec_nm_output.int - The fully decoded output of the messageless
                    MPEG-2 decoder in the format the data is sent
                    to the image displayer.
dec_nm_parsed.int - The output of the MPEG-2 decoder file parser.
dec_nm_blockdecode.int - Just the block decoding output
dec_nm_lum_channel_input.int - The luminance data right before being 
                               passed to the motion compensation step.
dec_nm_color_channels_input.int - The color data right before being
                                  passed to the motion compensation and
                                  upsampling step.
dec_nm_lum_channel_output.int
dec_nm_cb_channel_output.int
dec_nm_cr_channel_output.int  - The color data right after the motion
                                compensation and upsampling step.
