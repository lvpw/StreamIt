  <description>
This is the Time Delay Equalization phase from the GMTI (Ground Moving
Target Indiciator) application using the "Small" input dataset.

    <impl lang="StreamIt" dir="streamit" id="tde" compile_time="4800" run_time="2400">
      <file>tde.str</file>
      <desc>Performs a 12-way data-parallel version of the algorithm (just a
convolution), imitating the way that the C code from this phase in
GMTI would be compiled by RStream and parallelized.  Makes no pretense
at ordering the output data in a canonical way: it is expected to
connect with another GMTI phase that has been parallelized in such a
way as to accept its data.</desc>

    <impl lang="StreamIt" dir="streamit" id="tde-pp" compile_time="4800" run_time="3600">
      <file>tde_pp.str</file>
      <desc>Pipeline-parallel version of the application that is a more natural
fit to StreamIt.  There is some data-parallelism available by setting
parameters in tde_pp.str, which allows us to increase the number of
filters for use in performance studies.  This version canonicalizes
the order of the output data.</desc>
