  <description>
This is the Time Delay Equalization phase from the GMTI application using
the "Samll" input dataset.  The tde.str version performs a 12-way data-parallel
version of the algorithm (just a convolution), imitating the way that the
C code from this phase in GMTI would be compiled by RStream and parallelized.
The tde_pp.str version is coded in a style more natural to StreamIt using
pipeline parallelism.  There is some data-parallelism available by setting
parameters in tde_pp.str, which allows us to increase the number of filters
for use in performance studies.  tde.str makes no pretense at ordering the 
output data in a canonical way: it is expected to connect with another GMTI 
phase that has been parallelized in such a way as to accept its data. 
tde_pp.str canonicalizes the order of the output data.
