The StreamIt beamformer follows the implementation in the reference C code
(modeled after ../c/optimized.c).

The input to the pipeline is found in ../data/str-data
There are two input files: data1.bin and data2.bin
Both are generated from their text counterparts in ../data/c-data/near-field
using the conversion program in ../data

The expected output for data1.bin is ../data/str-data/near-field/data1.out, and
the expected output for data2.bin is ../data/str-data/near-field/data2.out

To run data1.out, edit Audiobeam.str to select filename in top level pipeline
./a.out -i 387 > data1.out
  # the input file has 400 samples, and requires 13 samples for the peek buffer

To run data2.out, edit Audiobeam.str to select filename in top level pipeline (default)
./a.out -i 19987 > data2.out
  # the input file has 20K samples, and requires 13 samples for the peek buffer

To check results use either of the following respectively
spiff -q -r .0001 data1.out ../data/str-data/near-field/data1.out
spiff -q -r .0001 data2.out ../data/str-data/near-field/data2.out

spiff is a version of diff that ignores floating point differences below the 
specified threshold (-r threshold)
