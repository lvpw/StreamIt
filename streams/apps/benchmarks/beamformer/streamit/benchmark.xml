  <description>
Template application to perform beam-forming on a set of inputs.  The
input file should be preprocessed with 'cpp'; running 'make' will
produce all of the possible outputs.  Each input passes through an FIR
filter which amplifies inputs with a particular delay from the source,
and then tests if the result is greater than some threshold.  The
"coarse" beam former decimates its input to perform less actual
calculation; the "serialized" beam former collects all of its outputs
and prints them, rather than printing them in the child stages.
