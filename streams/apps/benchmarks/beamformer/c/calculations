7/26/02 -- AAL 
got rid of the code that writes to files, stuck main body in loop that runs three times, 



Uniprocessor (7/29/2002):
(Xenon 2.2 GHz, 512MB cache)
100,000 iterations (1 outputs/iteration)
99.9% utilization
runtime for 100,000 iterations = 110.450 seconds

We want cycles/iteration:
100000 iterations/ 110.450 sec * 
1 outputs/1 iteration
1 second /2.2x10^9 cycles
* 10^5 cycles 

= 0.041153957 outputs/10^5 cycles
