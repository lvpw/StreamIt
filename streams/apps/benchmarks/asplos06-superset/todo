* create a list of all the places where one could keep adding to a slice
	* rank them by amount of wasted work that would be added vs
	off chip communication saved.
	* how to calculate the wasted work?
	* assume that we have slices that are as large as possible
	* then start cutting at places with the highest saving in terms of wasted work
	* when to stop?  


* find the total size of the buffers!!!
	Could remove the need to go off chip!

* get some bandwidth vs ops numbers for different processors!

* Try different steadymults with adaptive  
 
* Try different slice threshs around 66...

* Finish up calc params

* FFT no complex 
 
* try beamformer with multiple file writers

* Applications:
  * Can add anything else?  (without structs?)

* We take advantage of outer loops
