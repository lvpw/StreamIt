tde.str from benchmarks/streamit/tde.  A frequency-domain convolution, and 
check results.  Parameter to change is number of convolutoins being performed
as branches of a splitjoin.

      PAR    filters   strc behavior        -library behavior
tde    12    16        seg fault if i > 12  "code too large" error on do_all
tde1   25    29        seg fault if i > 8
tde2   50    54        seg fault if i > 4
tde3   64    68        seg fault if i > 6
tde4   75    79        seg fault if i > 10
tde5  100   104        seg fault if i > 2

these are challenging because of the amount of code generated: the library 
implementation can not execute the do_all method because it can not handle the
size of the method.

tdeX.str generates an output file tdeX.out.  Compare with ../output/
There are versions generated with strc (-i 1) in ../output/  It doesn't 
seem to be useful to have more than 1 steady-state execution since all should
calculate the same thing...
