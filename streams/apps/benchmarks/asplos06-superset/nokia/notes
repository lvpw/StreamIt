from nokia/streamit/dcalc.str

Now creates its output in dcalc.out.  Compare with ../output/, which contains 
result of "strc -library -i 100 dcalc.str"

Should be paraterizable.  nokia/streamit/AdapTest.java shows a version with 
K=3; N=3; Q=2; W=3; and C={{1,3,7}, {2,0,5}, {3,0,0}}
Unfirtunately, there is mor to be done, since just those changes result
in an ArrayIndex out of bounds error.
