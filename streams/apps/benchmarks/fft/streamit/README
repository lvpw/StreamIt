There are several implementations of FFT in this directory.

FFT3:
 - reliable version that gets the right answer (checks with fftref)
 - inputs in natural order, outputs in bit-reversed order
 - fine-grained decimation-in-time implementation
 - properly handles real/imag parts and roots of unity weights

fftref:
 - reference implementation in C, corresponding to FFT3

FFT2:
 - A blocked version that we've been using as a benchmark for
   publications (appears also in benchmarks directory.)
 - inputs in natural order, outputs in natural order (that is, unlike
   FFT3, it includes a bit-reverse stage)
 - FFT2_opt.java just duplicates the main pipeline in a splitjoin to
   improve performance on Raw

FFT:
 - Derived from our original, very fine-grained implementation in the
   CC paper, but without the bit-reverse stage (which had a bug)
 - Now inputs in bit-reversed order, outputs in natural order
 - Has dummy weights -- doesn't actually compute the FFT.
