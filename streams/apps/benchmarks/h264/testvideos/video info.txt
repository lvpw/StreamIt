YUV 4:2:0 Video Sequences
Notes by Shirley Fung

Source: http://trace.eas.asu.edu/

You cannot actually find this info from their website, and from
a bit of reverse engineering using different players, I was able to
figure out the correct format for these videos.

The test video sequences are in YUV planar format, which means that
each image in the video sequence has 3 arrays, an array for each Y,
U (Cr), and V (Cb) values. Each color values is 1 byte (8 bits).

The videos are sampled at 4:2:0, which means that the crominance values
are subsampled by half in the vertical and horizontal directions.
