YUV 4:2:0 Video Sequences
Notes by Shirley Fung

Source: http://trace.eas.asu.edu/

You cannot actually find this info from their website, and from
a bit of reverse engineering using different players, I was able to
figure out the correct format for these videos.

The test video sequences are in YUV planar format, which means that
each image in the video sequence has 3 arrays, an array for each Y,
U (Cr), and V (Cb) values. Each color values is 1 byte (8 bits). Note
that YCrCb values are unsigned.

Format is little endian:
The least significant byte (LSB) value, is at the lowest address. 
The other bytes follow in increasing order of significance. Therefore
First bit read from file will be the least significant bit.

Refer to I420 format from http://www.FOURCC.org:

The videos are sampled at 4:2:0, which means that the crominance values
are subsampled by half in the vertical and horizontal directions.
