Plaintext: 
    - modify Source.str to change the input plaint text
    - currently includes 34 64-bit plain texts for encoding

Key: 
    - modify USERKEYS in Statics.str to edit the user key
    - currently includes 34 64-bit user keys for encoding

Compile:
    - strc DES.str Keys.str Source.str Utils.str Sboxes.str Statics.str -o des

Run: 
    - ./des -i1
    - only need to run 1 iteration of the top level pipeline
    - more iterations will just encrypt the same plaintext
    - top level pipeline currently programmed to encode N in 
      [1..34] plain texts using 1 of N different keys

Expected output:
    - see ../output/output.txt

NOTES:
- the key schedule implementation (in Keys.str) is currently
inefficient because at each round, it recalculates all previous
intermediate keys; this is not necessary and should be done at init
time instead (the current implementation is the most straightforward
and hence the reason it is chosen)
