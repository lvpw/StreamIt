/* What happens if back edge is unused? 
 * Hopefully does not work:
 * in compilers gives a type error in RenameAll, 
 * in library gives a divide by 0 in scheduling 
 * in library -nosched actually puts out a sequence of numbers,
 * but what we want to check is that compilers reject this program
 * since none are set up to have no loop edge back to joiner.
