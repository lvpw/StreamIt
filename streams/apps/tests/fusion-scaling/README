This directory contains some scripts used to evaluate different fusion
policies for the LCTES'05 paper.

The Scaling.str file in this directory is the template that is used
for all the results.  DO NOT EDIT IT if you want the scripts to keep
working.

The scripts evaluate fusino performance for different peek values.

To use the scaling scripts, choose your favorite architecture:

ia64
p3-gcc2.9
p3-gcc3.4

Go into the appropriate directory and type "make".  This will produce
two scripts:

docompile.sh -- a script for compiling the benchmarks.
dorun.sh     -- a script for running the benchmarks.

The results will be put in "results.csv" in the appropriate directory.
