This directory contains some scripts used to evaluate different fusion
policies for the LCTES'05 paper.

The Scaling.str file in this directory is the template that is used
for all the results.  DO NOT EDIT IT if you want the scripts to keep
working.

The scripts evaluate fusion performance for different peek values.

To use the scaling scripts, choose your favorite architecture:

ia64
p3

Go into the appropriate directory and type "make".  This will produce
two scripts:

docompile.sh -- a script for compiling the benchmarks.
dorun.sh     -- a script for running the benchmarks.

The results will be put in "results.csv" in the appropriate directory.

One quirk: the ia64 script keeps a separate directory for each
benchmark and builds it right before timing because the build must be
done on an Itanium.  For the P3, the build can be done on another
machine, so it is done during the compile script to save space and
runtime.
