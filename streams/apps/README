The structure of the apps directory is as follows:

apps/examples     -- Simple example source files for beginners to read
apps/applications -- Full featured, (eg complicated) apps
apps/benchmarks   -- Current benchmarks (currently these were used in ASPLOS to compare performance)
apps/tests        -- Applications that are for testing specific pieces of the streamit compiler (eg regtest)
apps/old          -- Random mung that seems to have collected in CVS and that I don't



Here is a partial list of the applications contained in this the sub directories.

old/AMRadio		An old attempt at an AMRadio (not using now)

benchmarks/beamformer	The original Beamformer implementation, which leads
			to buffer overflow.

applications/crc	CRC encoder and decoder.

FMRadio			An old FMRadio; new one is in docs/examples/hand/fm.

Gsm			GSM vocoder.

libraries		Miscellaneous library filters used by other apps.

matrixmult		Matrix multiplication.

mp3decoder		Parts of an MP3 decoder (beginning stages still 
			unimplemented since they are variable rate).

old/PCADemo			An old version of the Beamformer, modeled off of
			unclassified example program from Lincoln Lab
			for DARPA's Polymorphic Computing Architecture (PCA)

old/perftest4		A performance test from Spectrumware.

/home/streamit/specs	Specifications of applications we're implementing.
