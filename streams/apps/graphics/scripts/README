Scripts used for graphics apps.

adjustJava.py
=============
Takes a .java file as input.  It expects the .java output of:
"java streamit.frontend.ToJava --library --output GPUModel.java GPUModel.str"
The script puts some hacks into it so that you can run it in the library
and see a reasonable output.

strcm.py
========
Takes a filename as an argument.
The first line of the file is the output filename.
Followed by a filename on each line.
The script simply concatenates them together into one big .str file.

xyToPPM.py
==========
Usage: xyToPPM.py colorBuffer.xy widthxheight
Takes an input colorBuffer.xy file and a resolution.
Outputs a displayable colorBuffer.xy.ppm file.

convert_input_array
===================
Technically not a script.  The source .c is in the same directory.
Usage: convert_input_array input.txt output.bin

Reads input.txt, expecting 1 float (as ASCII) per line.
Outputs to output.bin in binary, followed by 100 dummy values.

Useful for creating files to be read by InputReaders.
