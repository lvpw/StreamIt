There are two versions of the regression test:

OBSOLETE:
The streamittest, and tools subdirectories are a Junit-based version
of regression testing with some Perl superstructure that is no longer
being actively maintained or updated.

CURRENT:
The qmtest subdirectory has tools and Python scripts based on QMtest
(http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/).  There is some further
description in qmtest/testsys.tex.

Results of nightly regression tests are currently stored on
/home/bits8/streamit/regtest/  as well as being mailed to
streamit-regtest@cag.lcs.mit.edu

For information about running your own regression test, see ./qmtest/testsys.ps
