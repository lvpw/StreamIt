There are two versions of the regression test:

OBSOLETE:
The streamittest, and tools subdirectories are a Junit-based version
of regression testing with some Perl superstructure that is no longer
being actively maintained or updated.

If you want to compare files of ASCII representations of floating point numbers
allowing small discrepancies, then tools/compare_uni.pl will still be useful.
you will need to 
$cd $STREAMIT_HOME/regtest/tools
to run it, or update your PERL5LIB envieonment variable.

CURRENT:
The qmtest subdirectory has tools and Python scripts based on QMtest
(http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest/).  There is some further
description in qmtest/testsys.tex.

Results of nightly regression tests are currently stored on
/home/bits8/streamit/regtest/  as well as being mailed to
streamit-regtest@cag.lcs.mit.edu

For information about running your own regression test, see ./qmtest/testsys.ps
