FarmLocal 
---------

This is a stripped-down version of FarmIt that runs on the local
machine.  No problems with jobs left hanging, etc.

FarmIt
------

A number gathering script that farms out compiles/runs on specified
cagfarms and gathers all of the results into a one file that is in an
excel-friendly format.

IT DOES NOT CHECK FOR CORRECTNESS!  That is left to the reg test.

usage:

"FarmIt low_raw_size high_row_size starting_cagfarm ending_cagfarm
compiler_options benchmark_file output_file bloodgraph_directory"

A simple example should suffice to explain the options:

FarmIt 1 8 22 33 "-a -N 5" working_benchmarks results /u/mgordon/blood

The above states that we want to run the benchmarks listed in the file
"working_benchmarks" on raw sizes 1x1 thru 8x8 (inclusive) on cagfarms
22 thru 33 with the options "-a -N 5" (the -raw option is
automatically generated) and place the results in the file "results" and
the generated blood graphs in /u/mgordon/blood

Preliminaries:

* You must setup ssh-agent to allow ssh logins without passwords.  It is
not hard...
http://www.csua.berkeley.edu/ssh-howto.html#agent

* At the beginning of the script, the script will try to log into each
machine that you have specified and print the date in sequence, 
if you have never logged on that machine before you will have to
answer yes to accept the machine's public key.  If it cannot log on to
a specific machine, it will not try to run jobs on that machine.

* You should run the script on a machine different from the ones
you are farming out the runs on.

* STREAMIT_HOME must be defined

* you can change the working directory of the script.  Right now it
runs everything on /home/bits6/NO_BACKUP/$USER/results.  This
directory must exist before the script runs (it will yell at you if it
does not exist).

* You must specify "-N x" in the options argument.  This scripts relies
on -N to generate the results.  It will just run the benchmarks without
-N and delete all the tmp files.

* "benchmarks" file: on separate lines, the absolute path name of each
java file that you want to run (with the .java extension).  
It only supports apps that are a single file (so use Linked*.java).
See the file working_benchmarks in this directory for an example.

* I think you can run multiple instances of this script concurrently
as long as the work machines are different for the different instances,  
I have not tested it though.

Output:

It places all of the results in "outputfile" in a format that is
easily imported into excel.  All columns are delimited by ";" and text
is quoted.  To import into excel, open the file in excel.  It will
bring up the "Text Import Wizard".  Select delimited then next.  Check
off semicolon and change the "text qualifier to {none}", then click finished.
