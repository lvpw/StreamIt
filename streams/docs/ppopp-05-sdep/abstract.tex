We formulate a stream dependence function, $\sdep$, which describes
the ordering constraints between node executions in a concurrent
stream graph. This dependence information is similar to a program
slice in procedural programs and carries with it many of the
applications of slicing, including debugging and program analysis.
However, unlike slicing, we restrict our input domain to a Synchronous
Dataflow (SDF) graph, which is a natural representation for many
signal processing applications.  We leverage the static properties of
SDF to compute $\sdep$ exactly at compile time and to store the
dependence information compactly.

Using $\sdep$, we develop a novel language construct for precise event
handling in stream programs.  The construct uses the dependence
information to provide a common notion of time across distributed
components.  Based on a case study of a software radio, we argue that
the language feature significantly improves programmer
productivity. We have also implemented fully-automatic support for
this feature in the StreamIt compiler infrastructure, with a backend
for a cluster of workstations.  We demonstrate that for our case
study, incorporating precise event handling into the language improves
performance by an average of 48\%.
