In this paper, we develop a new language construct to address one of
the pitfalls of parallel programming: precise handling of events
across parallel components.  The construct, termed {\it teleport
messaging}, uses dependences between components to provide a common
notion of time in a parallel system.  Our work is done in the context
of the Synchronous Dataflow (SDF) model, in which computation is
expressed as a graph of independent components (or {\it actors}) that
communicate in regular patterns over data channels.  We leverage the
static properties of SDF to compute a stream dependence function,
$\sdep$, that compactly describes the exact ordering constraints
between actor executions.

Teleport messaging utilizes $\sdep$ to provide powerful and precise
event handling.  For example, an actor $A$ can specify that an event
should be processed by a downstream actor $B$ as soon as $B$ sees the
``effects'' of the current execution of $A$.  Based on a case study of
a software radio, we argue that teleport messaging improves
readability and robustness over existing practices.  We have also
implemented messaging within the StreamIt compiler, with a backend for
a cluster of workstations.  As teleport messaging exposes optimization
opportunities to the compiler, it also results in a 49\% performance
improvement for our case study.
