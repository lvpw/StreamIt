\newcommand{\slidingwindows}{Sliding windows are common.  The language
  must expose the parallelism in sliding windows to avoid a
  computational bottleneck}

\newcommand{\startup}{Startup behaviors often differ from steady-state
  behaviors.  The compiler must recognize such behaviors to avoid a
  parallel bottleneck}

\newcommand{\stateful}{Sequential (stateful) filters are required in
  one quarter of our benchmarks.  Further state could be eliminated
  via new language constructs, compiler analyses, or programmer
  interventions}

\newcommand{\feedback}{Feedback loops are uncommon in our benchmarks,
  but represent significant bottlenecks when present}

\newcommand{\matchedrates}{Neighboring filters often have matched I/O
  rates.  This reduces the opportunity and impact of advanced
  scheduling strategies proposed in the literature}

\newcommand{\dynamicrates}{Dynamic rates are uncommon in our
  benchmarks, but implement critical functionality when utilized}

\newcommand{\cyclostatic}{It is not useful for filters to divide their
  atomic execution step into a cycle of smaller steps.  However,
  multiple execution steps are important for scatter/gather stages}

\newcommand{\inferrates}{The I/O rates of a filter can typically be
  inferred automatically (the general case is undecidable)}

\newcommand{\structuredstreams}{It is useful and tractable to write
  programs using structured streams, in which all modules have a
  single input and a single output.  However, structured streams are
  occasionally unnatural and, in rare cases, insufficient}

\newcommand{\accidentalstate}{Programmers can accidentally introduce
  unnecessary sequential bottlenecks (mutable state) in filters}

\newcommand{\teleportmessaging}{Stream programs benefit from a
  separation of high-bandwidth data flow and irregular control
  signals.  This is evidenced by modest usage of teleport messaging in
  our applications}
