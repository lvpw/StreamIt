%%% Scientific things that use SARE's

- for sare conversion, it should be "dataflow analysis of array and
  scalar refernces" instead of the scheduling paper fr/ feautrier

- could reference the alpha system, Tanguy Risset, the Alpha homepage,

add application:
- hardware synthesis (systolic synthesis) [could reference opera project,
http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/opera/home.html]

look for:

* lee/kedem, mapping nested loop algorithms into multidimensional systolic arrays
* quinton, the mapping of linear recurrence equations on regular arrays
* moldovan, on the analysis and synthesis of vlsi systolic arrays

  -> definately related, looking at converting something with
     different rates (decimation factors) but still constant
     requirements of computation, into a systolic array.

- mongonet, a geometrical coding to compile affine recurrence equations on regular arrays

is this the only synthesis paper i can find?
S. V. Rajopadhye, S. Purushothaman and R. M. Fujimoto. 

On Synthesizing Systolic arrays from Recurrence Equations with linear dependencies
in FST &TCS, 1986 
--

here's something more on synthesis:
Patrice Quinton: Automatic Synthesis of Systolic Arrays from Uniform Recurrent Equations. ISCA 

something else on uniformization:

--
Journal of VLSI Signal Processing Systems >archive
Volume 11 ,  Issue 1-2   Oct./Nov. 1995 >toc
Special issue on VLSI design methodologies for digital signal processing systems 

Converting affine recurrence equations to quasi-uniform recurrence equations
--

this could have some overlap with what i'm doing in this paper:  Multirate VLSI Arrays and Their Synthesis 

this also looks relevant:
A. Kerihuel, R. McConnell, S. Rajopadhye. VSDF: synchronous data flow for VLSI.  Proceedings of the 37th Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, Lafayette, Louisiane, Aot, 1994
