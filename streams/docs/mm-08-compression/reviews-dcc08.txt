Comments for the authors:
This is a beautiful applied paper, showing how data can be efficiently
manipulated in compressed form in specific applications such as image
and video editing. Although there is no much theory behind, it is a
serious work that works in the real world, with a real implementation.
I found it very interesting and motivating.

The idea of a compiler, that permits translating arbitrary operations,
is also very nice.

Definitely as poster, possibly as a paper
Comments for the authors.
I found this to be an interesting, nicely written and probably useful
result.  It would have been nice to see a formal, more general
treatment accompanying the specific application discussed in the
paper.

Strong accept as poster, not as paper.
Comments for the authors:
The paper propose a method to operate image transformation on
LZ77-compressed data, specifically Apple Animation video format.

The technique appears to me not very sophisticated, but it could
certainly be useful to the video community.
