We present a translation scheme that allows a class of dataflow graphs
to be considered under the optimization framework of the polyhedral
model.  The input to our analysis is a Cyclo-Static Dataflow Graph,
which is a popular model of computation in the DSP domain.  The output
of our analysis is a System of Affine Recurrence Equations (SARE) that
exactly captures the data dependences between the nodes of the
original graph.  Using the SARE representation, one can apply many
techniques from the systolic and scientific communities that are new
to the DSP domain.  For example, we propose simple optimizations such
as node splitting, and decimation propagation that leverage the
fine-grained dependence information of the SARE to perform novel
transformations on a stream graph.  We also propose ways in which the
polyhedral model can offer new approaches to classic problems of the
DSP community, such as minimizing buffer size, code size, and
optimizing the schedule.
