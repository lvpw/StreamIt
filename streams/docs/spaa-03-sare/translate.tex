\section{General Translation: CSDP to SARE}
\label{sec:translate}

In this section we give the formal translation of a Cyclo-Static
Dataflow Program to a System of Affine Recurrence Equations.  Again,
the SARE will be parameterized by $N$, the number of steady-state
cycles that one wishes to execute in the CSDP.  The translation will
use the helper functions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:helper}.  We also
make use of the $S(n)$ function giving the number of steady-state
executions of node $n$ (see Section~\ref{sec:balance}).  
%Please refer

%described below.

Figure~\ref{fig:csdptosare1} illustrates the variables used for the
translation.  These are very similar to those in the simple case,
except that now there are separate variables for each phase.  The
equations for the translation appear in Figure~\ref{fig:csdptosare3}.
