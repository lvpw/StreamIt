\section{Conclusion}

This paper shows that the inter-node dependences of a Cyclo-Static
Dataflow Graph can be cleanly represented as a System of Affine
Recurrence Equations.  In combination with Feautrier's array dataflow
analysis~\cite{Feautrier01} for deducing intra-node dependences, this
establishes the SARE as a unified analysis and optimization framework
for high-level DSP programming models.

We believe that the precise affine dependence framework provided by
the SARE representation will enable a powerful suite of node
optimizations in dataflow graphs.  The SARE is a robust and
well-established framework within the systolic and scientific
communities, with methods for graph parameterization, automatic
parallelization, and storage optimization.  We propose optimizations
such as decimation propagation and node fission that are first
applications of these techniques to the signal processing domain.
