Introduction
* streaming, important class of applications
* multicores require parallelization
* data parallelization is great
* want to expose as much data parallelism as possible
* sliding windows is an important class of computation in certain domains
* show what sliding window looks like in C, ugly hard to parallelize
* contrast with explicit support in StreamIt and Brook, lime, and spl
* motivational numbers: don't parallelize peeking filters
* motivation for optimization of parallelization of sliding window computations
