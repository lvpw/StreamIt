  //For this system, DFT_LENGTH_NOM is the nominal number of DFT
  //coefficients to use when taking the DFT.  Thus the behaviour of
  //the system is that there are DFT_LENGTH_NOM filters between 
  //[0, 2 * pi).  

  //This code assumes that the DFT_LENGTH_NOM is even, so that the
  //range (pi, 2 * pi) is just a reflection of the range (0, pi).
  //This is because the input signal is real and discrete;
  //discreteness means the fourier transform is periodic with 2 * pi,
  //and since the signal is real the magnitude of the DFT will be even
  //and the phase odd.  Since we only care about the real output of
  //the system, and are only doing the inverse DFT for a single sample
  //at the center of the window, the phase being odd makes no
  //difference.  Thus with filters in the range [0, pi], the entire
  //fourier transform can be represented, thus using approximately
  //half the filters and computation.

   *            that it's a voice unless you already know
   *  
   *         8: can tell that it's a person talking, if you already
   *            know the script, you can follow the voice
   *
   *        16: can tell that it's a person, can understand the words,
   *            can kind of see that the vocoder is doing something 
   *            that may be appropriate
   *
   *        32: better output; less grainy, more believable
   *        64: still better output
   *
   *       128: probably the high-point of good output
   *            vs. computation * and size.  With 128, it'll tradeof
   *            quality in output for * time.
