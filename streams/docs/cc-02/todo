TODO with little things
-----------------------

- uggh, common machine language into abstract?

- in the echo figure, could have that pipeline not having four stages.
also don't like the adder in there--not clear what it's doing.

- mention somewhere what the identity filter is.

- add the arrows on the messaging stuff

- acknowledgements - matt frank, streamit team.

- change things to be FIRFilter instead of just FIR

- double-check delay in checkhop with that in WIP submission, which I
had sanitized

- be consistent about truetype versus non - see what the cc formatting
guidelines recommend

- layout pass.  really need to run the typsetting stuff by someone.

TODO on net
-----------

- get reference for amps cellular base station, gsm, bluetooth

TODO with Saman
---------------

- (NOTE) having the setInput / setOutput type in the init function
also allows for parameterizable types, which could be interesting, I
guess.  or could be bad?  might be good if switching between
byte/int/char at runtime, or something, but maybe these things should
be

- (NOTE) the pop/peek/push thing without a float arg is also illegal
java.  unless we make float the default, I guess.  hmm.

TODO with very low priority
---------------------------

- making sure the two-column figures are centered perfectly

- redo the radio diagram to have arrows connecting the stages, and
better labels.  actually just a better diagram.

- could rewrite the example (dry/detailed)
