We present a dynamic programming algorithm that partitions a static stream
graph for load-balanced execution on a parallel target.  Our work is done in
the context of StreamIt, a high-level stream programming language in which
filters are connected using a set of hierarchical primitives.  Our algorithm
exploits the hierarchy of the stream graph to define overlapping
sub-problems, thereby allowing us to explore a large space of alternate
partitionings in polynomial time.  We have implemented the algorithm in the
StreamIt compiler for the Raw architecture, and we demonstrate performance
improvements over a greedy load-balancing strategy.
