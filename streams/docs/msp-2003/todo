x simulatework issues (breaks fm)
- understand mergesort, lattice, beamformer, filterbank
- try some much bigger apps?
- gathering bitonic numbers without printer

- finish implementing identity support (not for paper)
- updating "2" versions of apps in CVS

--------------------------

need 5.5 more pages

in paper:
---------
- talk about graph restructuring algorithms (1)
  - make pseudocode out of all the cutting things (2)
  - format the graphs
- examples of why greedy does bad (0.5)
  - in pipeline
  - in splitjoin
- speedup graphs of performance vs. number of tiles (1)
- example of greedy vs. dynamic programming partitioning (filterbank) (1)

implementation:
---------------
* implementing other algorithm for greedy partitioning (jasper)
* get final set of numbers

other research things:
-----------------------
- effect of symmetry optimization on compile time?
- linear fission?
- scaling results as we go past 256?
- magic network?
- different optimization levels?  simulatework?
