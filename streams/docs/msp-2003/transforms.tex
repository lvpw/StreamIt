\section{Graph Transformations}
\label{sec:transforms}

We have developed a large suite of graph transformations that can be
used to adjust the hierarchy and communication patterns of a
structured stream graph.  These transformations--which include filter
fusion, filter fission, horizontal cuts, vertical cuts, and aggressive
synchronization removal--serve two distinct purposes.  Firstly, they
provide a means of deriving a canonical form: a program representation
that is insensitive to changes in the source code and is easily
analyzed by the compiler (for example, the hierarchical ragged arrays
of the partitioner).  Secondly, they serve as the implementation
mechanism by which the compiler arrives at an efficient executable
once it has analyzed the canonical form (for example, the
partitioner's traceback function).  In our final paper, we will
describe these transformations in detail, as well as their role in the
structured partitioning algorithm.
