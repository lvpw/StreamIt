Applications centered around streams of data are becoming increasingly
important and widespread, especially in the context of embedded
processors with resource constraints.  In this paper, we present a
high-level translation scheme that allows a broad class of stream
programs to be considered under the scheduling framework of the
polyhedral model.  The input to our analysis is an abstract stream
graph from StreamIt, a high-level stream programming language.  The
output of our analysis is a System of Affine Recurrence Equations
(SARE) that exactly captures the data dependences and exposes all of
the parallelism in the original graph.  We leverage well-known affine
scheduling techniques of the scientific community to demonstrate that
the SARE representation can be used for effective scheduling of stream
programs onto a parallel target.
