\section{Realizations / Changes}

\begin{enumerate}

\item When we're inlining filters, we don't need to provide the name
of the filter.

\item It's a misnomer to call the toplevel stream a {\tt FilterBlock},
since it has no input and output.  Let's call it a {\tt Stream}
instead?  Also, why name it, since there can be only one of them and
it's not accepting parameters?  Let's just say {\tt Stream} at the
toplevel.

\item I'm again of the opinion that control constructs should return
objects.  It's very difficult to explain what they *do* return (or
represent) if it's not an object--it's a collection of blocks, but
it's a control construct?  Then what if it's exactly one block?  Then
it's not an object anymore?  Doesn't make sense.

\item Is it ok not to require break statements at the end of each {\tt
case} in a {\tt StreamSelect}?  We'd differ from standard convention,
but would anyone use the fall-through feature?

\end{enumerate}
