\section{Open questions}

\begin{enumerate}

\item What are the semantics of re-initialization of filter blocks?
What do we do about flushing pipelines, etc?

\item If we're building on top of C, then how do we pass a string
between filters without using pointers?  What is the exact restriction
on pointers, then?

\item More generally than above, what's the syntax of stuff that's not
streaming?  Is it C, Java, something subset or combination thereof?

\item Do we want the message delivery units to be in terms of the {\it
receiever's} work function?  It seems like that might make more sense
to the programmer (?)

\item Why don't we change messages to be arbitrary point-to-point
function calls?  Then the names could be more descriptive than {\tt
handleMessage}, and multiple parameters could be passed instead of
having to pack and unpack a user-defined structure.  (Also, just
dispatching method calls on the type of structure could be
confusing--for instance, if two different senders want to send the
same type of data to different targets within a filter block.)

\end{enumerate}
