\section{To improve this document...}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Add lots of examples.

\item Replace my dinky syntax defs with the actual grammar.

\item Better / more clear distinction between initialization time and
steady state streaming time.  And then scripting time, too.

\item Better names for everything.  Especially control constructs
(graph construction constructs instead?), filters, ``functional
blocks'', etc.

\item Get number layered 4 deep instead of boldface headings.

\item Add a section on scheduling guarantees (or lack thereof.)

\item Define terms earlier (blocks vs. 1-to-1 blocks, etc.)

\item Make it clear that FilterBlocks can contain streams, not just
blocks.

\end{enumerate}
