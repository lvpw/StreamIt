\section{The Base Language}

The StreaMIT base language allows the programmer to define processing
units and to arrange them into a stream.  Thus, the base language can
be broken down into two levels: 1) the definition of {\it functional
blocks} to transform one data stream into another, and 2) the use of
{\it control constructs} to arrange the objects into a streaming
structure.  Additionally, the language provides a set of dynamic
constructs for passing messages, re-initializing stream components,
and modifying the structure while the stream is executing.

In the following sections, we describe the StreaMIT base language from
the bottom up: functional blocks (Section \ref{sec:blocks}), control
constructs (Section \ref{sec:control}) and dynamic constructs (Section
\ref{sec:dynamic}).
