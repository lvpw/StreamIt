We characterize high-performance streaming applications as a new and
distinct domain of programs that is becoming increasingly important.
The StreamIt language provides novel high-level representations to
improve programmer productivity and program robustness within the
streaming domain.  At the same time, the StreamIt compiler aims to
improve the performance of streaming applications via stream-specific
analysis and optimizations.  In this paper, we motivate, describe and
justify the language features of StreamIt, which include a structured
model of streams, a messaging system for control, a re-initialization
mechanism, and a natural textual syntax.

% We also present a means of reasoning about time in terms of
% ``information flow'': a concept that we believe is fundamental to the
% streaming domain.
