\begin{itemize}
\item 28 May 2003 snapshot release.
\item Including benchmark programs in the snapshot release.
\item Adding support for N x M configurations on Raw (not just N x N).
\item Drastically improved compile time and memory usage for the compiler.
\item Improved performance and generality of the linear optimizations, and
  new selection algorithm for when to apply linear optimizations (use
  with --linearpartition option).
\item Improved robustness of the dynamic programming partitioner, and
  more fine-grained strategy for greedy partitioner.
\item Language specification and front-end broadened to include more
  conventional Java-like features, including a boolean primitive type
  and typecasts.  Anonymous stream declarations should be able to
  successfully reference variables defined in enclosing code.
\item Cause statements like push(pop() + pop()) to be strictly sequenced
  in the front-end by inserting temporary variables.
\item The front-end should correctly deal with multiple source files; pass
  them all on the 'knit' command line.
\item The representation of nested schedules is optimized, improving some 
  aspects of code generation.
\item Adding support for "magic network" simulation on Raw (see OPTIONS).
\item Correctness and performance fixes in fusion, constant propagation,
  and loop unrolling.
\end{itemize}
