streamit-snapshot-20030528
--------------------------

* 28 May 2003 snapshot release.
* Including benchmark programs in the snapshot release.
* Adding support for N x M configurations on Raw (not just N x N).
* Drastically improved compile time and memory usage for the compiler.
* Improved performance and generality of the linear optimizations, and
  new selection algorithm for when to apply linear optimizations (use
  with --linearpartition option).
* Improved robustness of the dynamic programming partitioner, and
  more fine-grained strategy for greedy partitioner.
* Language specification and front-end broadened to include more
  conventional Java-like features, including a boolean primitive type
  and typecasts.  Anonymous stream declarations should be able to
  successfully reference variables defined in enclosing code.
* Cause statements like push(pop() + pop()) to be strictly sequenced
  in the front-end by inserting temporary variables.
* The front-end should correctly deal with multiple source files; pass
  them all on the 'knit' command line.
* The representation of nested schedules is optimized, improving some 
  aspects of code generation.
* Adding support for "magic network" simulation on Raw (see OPTIONS).
* Correctness and performance fixes in fusion, constant propagation,
  and loop unrolling.
