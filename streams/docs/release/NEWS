streamit-snapshot-20030528
--------------------------

* 28 May 2003 snapshot release.
* Language specification and front-end broadened to include more
  conventional Java-like features, including a boolean primitive type
  and typecasts.  Anonymous stream declarations should be able to
  successfully reference variables defined in enclosing code.
* Cause statements like push(pop() + pop()) to be strictly sequenced
  in the front-end by inserting temporary variables.
* The front-end should correctly deal with multiple source files; pass
  them all on the 'knit' command line.
* Various fixes to reduce the memory footprint of the compiler.
* Correctness and performance fixes in fusion, constant propagation,
  and loop unrolling.
