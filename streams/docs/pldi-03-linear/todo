to add to paper:
---------------

- put in updated frequency transform stuff (Andrew)
- describe partitioning stuff (Bill)
- updated numbers (with new benchmarks?)
  - resolve Beamformer numbers

- editing / proofreading

to get more todo items:
-----------------------
- read paper carefully
- look at reviewers comments

high priority
-------------

- bill is confused with definitions of multiplication scaling

- note that we require a certain minimum value of e in the expansion
process!

low priority
------------

- make it explicit somewhere that whenever we introduce \lambda_x, we
also introduce A_x, b_x, e_x, o_x, u_x.

probably not doing
------------------

- say more about when linear combination is a good thing?  I think the
statement with the sum of non-zero elements is not entirely accurate.
