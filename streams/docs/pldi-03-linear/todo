high priority
------------

- add those references to cousot, karr

medium priority
---------------

- highlight different keywords in the partitioning pseudocode

- in freq, * figure for all of a matrix column shouldn't be the same as * figure for convolution!

low priority
------------
- fix all overfull hboxes

probably not doing
------------------
- make eps bounding box ratio constant

- possibly move the reference the combination examples to further forward in the combination section?

- give feel for how much frequency conversoin is helping 
  - compare combined nodes vs. non-combined nodes
  - also how much FFTW is working

- add somewhere:  can detect fft and move things into frequency region
  - or implement FFT the best way for architecture

- not sure I like "for non-expert DSP programmer" in abstract

- make the bibliography consistent

- some absolute references, e.g. transformation 5

- look at reviewer's comments again

- make sure it's clear what multiplication removal means

- Possibly add the comments of the fourth reviewer:
	"More technically, what I found most interesting about the paper is
	that in order to perform the optimization, the optimizer first
	attempts to extract from the program a high-level model (in this case,
	an affine transformer) which then serves as a clean representation for
	the filter transformations."

- make it explicit somewhere that whenever we introduce \lambda_x, we
  also introduce A_x, b_x, e_x, o_x, u_x.
- More benchmarks
- Include measurements of code size and data size for before/after transformed programs
- Add examples of frequency transformation (don't know how to do this)
- Doesn't like sampling conversion rate of 2/3. Results will get better for larger rates,
	should I change it? 441/220 (downsample from CD to MP3 rates) perhaps?
	(I don't think so...)

todo after PLDI
---------------
- some of commenting in LinearCost is obsolete
- remove linearreplacecalculator -- calls childcost.plus, which is wrong
