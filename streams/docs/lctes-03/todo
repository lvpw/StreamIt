low priority
------------

- make all the figures scale by the same amount when they're inserted
  into document (can do this by examining EPS bounding box size).  For
  example, feedbackloop is in bigger print than splitjoin in Figure 2.

medium priority
---------------

- note that there is more than one initialization schedule, as you
  could advance partway into the steady state.  this would effect
  the ordering of nodes in the steady state, but not the steady
  state multiplicity.

  - note that there is unique initialization schedule?

- y axis title, instead of "as % of", say "normalized to"

- give other examples of traces of execution?

high priority
-------------

- fix abstract, intro
- cite michal's thesis
- typeset the pseudocode, and split into different figures
- add citations where needed
- check latex compilation errors
- layout
- spelling
