- make all the figures scale by the same amount when they're inserted
  into document (can do this by examining EPS bounding box size).  For
  example, feedbackloop is in bigger print than splitjoin in Figure 2.

things missing / to fix
-----------------------

initialization
  - note that there is more than one initialization schedule, as you
    could advance partway into the steady state.  this would effect
    the ordering of nodes in the steady state, but not the steady
    state multiplicity.

  - note that there is unique initialization schedule?

scheduling algorithm

- maybe give other examples of traces of execution?
