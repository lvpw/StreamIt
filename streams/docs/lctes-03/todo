low priority
------------

- make all the figures scale by the same amount when they're inserted
  into document (can do this by examining EPS bounding box size).  For
  example, feedbackloop is in bigger print than splitjoin in Figure 2.

medium priority
---------------

- note that there is more than one initialization schedule, as you
  could advance partway into the steady state.  this would effect
  the ordering of nodes in the steady state, but not the steady
  state multiplicity.

  - note that there is unique initialization schedule?

- y axis title, instead of "as % of", say "normalized to"

- give other examples of traces of execution?

high priority
-------------

- fix abstract
- change code, data graph to only show buffer size
- cite michal's thesis
- typeset the pseudocode, and split into different figures
- add citations where needed
- go through ptolemy directory on cag and see which papers are relevant
  - also check p. 14 of bhatty's file
  - add the APGAN/mincut paper to related work
  - fix sentence in related work we were argueing about
- check latex compilation errors
- layout
- spelling


- fix the bibliography - especially some things that are completely
missing journal names.  (comparison of synchronou s and cyclostatic
dataflow; buffer merging; static scheduling of synchronous dataflow
graphs; cyclo-dynamic dtaflow; minimizing buffer requirements under
rate-optimal schedule; analyzing the realtime requireements; synthesis
of embedded software

- intuitive explanation of algorithm is confusing
- say we iterate the compression step
