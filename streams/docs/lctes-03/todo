low priority
------------

- make all the figures scale by the same amount when they're inserted
  into document (can do this by examining EPS bounding box size).  For
  example, feedbackloop is in bigger print than splitjoin in Figure 2.

medium priority
---------------

- note that there is more than one initialization schedule, as you
  could advance partway into the steady state.  this would effect
  the ordering of nodes in the steady state, but not the steady
  state multiplicity.

  - note that there is unique initialization schedule?

- y axis title, instead of "as % of", say "normalized to"

high priority
-------------

- check latex compilation errors
- layout
- spelling

- don't add schedule and code size in results?
- put some numbers in the abstract?

- intuitive explanation of algorithm is confusing?
- say that we do splitters, joiners??
