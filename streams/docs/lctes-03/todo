high priority
-------------

- don't cut-and-paset intro from CC, streamit section from ASPLOS

- still have refs to appendix

- I would remove {\tt } for all StreamIt, peek, pop, etc. keywwords

medium priority
---------------

- Figure 3, label which numbers are peek, pop, push

- make all the figures scale by the same amount when they're inserted
  into document (can do this by examining EPS bounding box size).  For
  example, feedbackloop is in bigger print than splitjoin in Figure 2.

low priority

things missing / to fix
-----------------------

- don't like the notation for steady state
  - esp., why have S_{s,c} = {e_s, o_s, u_s} if e_s, o_s, and u_s are already defined?
    --> oh, I see, because they're not defined in general.

- steady state vs. steady state schedule is still confusing

- initialization for peeking section, I think those rates can be
symoblic.

- more graphics!  instead of tables highlighting things, have figures,
and instead (or in addition to) results table, have a graph

- need to integrate the description of phasing and of single apparance

- important distinction: the steady state in relation to the entire
program, or in relation to your immediate parent

- redo the "sample stream operators".  They look like they're typeset
in illustrator slightly differently than the FM Radio.


---

- keep section 3 as scheduling basics, but make it include all the initialization details
  - say how to calculate steady state; note that schedule could just be steady-state multiplicities
- then next section in phases, with two special cases

*** should really push that this allows scheduling of tight
    feedbackloops, with GSM as an example.  Single appearance
    scheduling won't allow this to be done.

*** could also push this as a way of having cyclo-static dataflow go
    up into hierarchical levels, to take advantage of same properties
    it has at the node level.  also a way of taking advantage of
    cyclo-static stuff at the node level.

- need to think about figures that could really show what's going on
