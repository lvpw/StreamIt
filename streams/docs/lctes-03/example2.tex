\caption{{\small Example construction of phased schedules for the
splitjoin of Figure~\ref{fig:sjexlabel}.  First, execution is
simulated for one steady state according to a push schedule; the
stream graph is labeled with the number of items on each channel
following the firing of a shaded node.  Then, fine-grained phases are
formed that include executions of both the entry (A) and exit (D)
nodes.  Finally, the fine-grained phases are combined into
$\mt{maxPhases}$ phases, each of which is factored into a single
appearance schedule.  Note that buffer size increases with the
granularity of the phases, as shown at right.\protect\label{fig:sjex}}}
