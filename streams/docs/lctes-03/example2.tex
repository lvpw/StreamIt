\caption{{\small Example construction of phased schedules for the
splitjoin of Figure~\ref{fig:sjexlabel}.  First, the splitjoin's
execution is simulated for one steady state according to a push
schedule; the stream graph is labeled with the number of items on each
channel following the firing of a shaded node.  Then, fine-grained
phases are formed that include executions of both the entry (A) and
exit (D) nodes.  Finally, the fine-grained phases are combined into
$\mt{maxPhases}$ phases, each of which is factored into a single
appearance schedule.\protect\label{fig:sjex}}}
