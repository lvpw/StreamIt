advantages of this algorithm:
  - detecting symmetry and hierarchy to save time
    - work estimation
    - alisasing of child configurations
    - evaluating child configurations themselves
    - automatically calculating things that are best

- results
  - cuts along important places, in right directions
  - does fissoin and fusion

  - partitioner takes advantage of this in two ways: 
    1) by detecting symmetry and only calculating things once
    2) by drawing cuts along likely paths
    3) by automatically calculating some properties that are the best,
       e.g. if you have the same filter duplicated in a splitjoin

- show how we can provide rectangular abstraction on single-input, single-output streams
