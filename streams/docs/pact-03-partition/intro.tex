\section{Introduction}

Recent trends in both software hardware are accentuating the need for
high-level distributed stream programming.  On the software side,
applications centered around streams of data are becoming increasingly
important and widespread.  The stream abstraction is central to
embedded applications for hand-held computers, cell phones, and sensor
networks, as well as for high-performance applications such as cell
phone base stations, radar image processing, and hyper-spectral image
analysis.  

At the same time, with the wire delay problem looming ahead, there is
emerging a class of communication-exposed
architectures~\cite{raw-micro,trips,smartmemories}.  With replicated
processing units and distributed memory, these architectures are a
good match for the abundant parallelism and regular communication
patterns that are prevalent in stream programs.  However, if these
architectures are to be fully utilized, there needs to exist a
portable, high-level programming model that can be efficiently
compiled onto tomorrow's generation of machines.

This is the motivation of the StreamIt language and compiler.  The
StreamIt language provides high-level stream abstractions that aim to
improve the lives of both programmers and compiler writers.  One of
the novelties in StreamIt is the use of ``structured streams'': a
program consists of a set of concurrently executing filters that are
connected using a few hierarchical primitives.  We believe that
structured streams will offer critical benefits to software engineers,
just as structured control flow did many years ago.

In this paper, we explore the compiler side of structured stream
programming.  Though structure's restrictions on the programmer may be
beneficial, these restrictions on the compiler could become a curse
without proper analysis and optimizations.  Toward this end, we make
two contributions:
\begin{itemize}

\item A general dynamic programming algorithm for partitioning a
structured stream graph.  The algorithm exploits many aspects of the
graph's structure to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

\item An implementation of the partitioner in the context of load
balancing StreamIt programs on Raw~\cite{raw-micro}, where we
demonstrate improvements over a greedy algorithm by an average of
24\%.

\item A suite of refactoring transformations that can be performed on
a structured stream graph, which are critical for the implementation
of the above algorithms.
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows.  We first give
background information on the StreamIt language
(Section~\ref{sec:streamit}), and then give the abstract view of the
partitioning algorithm (Section 3).  We then describe a suite of graph
transformations for interfacing with the partitioner (Section 4)
before presenting experimental results (Section 5).  We then discuss
related work (Section 6) and conclude (Section 7).
