\section{Conclusion}

We have implemented 

\item A general dynamic programming algorithm for partitioning a
structured stream graph.  The algorithm exploits many aspects of the
graph's structure to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.

\item An implementation of the partitioner in the context of load
balancing StreamIt programs on Raw~\cite{raw-micro}, where we
demonstrate improvements over a greedy algorithm by an average of
24\%.

\item A suite of refactoring transformations that can be performed on
a structured stream graph, which are critical for the implementation
of the above algorithms.

- two thrusts: that structure actually SUPPORTS powerful ways of
program reasoning, and that we are flexible enough to manipulate
structured programs into a number of isomorphic forms.  can consider
structures on an abstract level, and then implement them in any number
of ways.
