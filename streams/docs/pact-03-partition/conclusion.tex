\section{Conclusion}

- two thrusts: that structure actually SUPPORTS powerful ways of
program reasoning, and that we are flexible enough to manipulate
structured programs into a number of isomorphic forms.  can consider
structures on an abstract level, and then implement them in any number
of ways.
