\section{Conclusion}

This paper shows that a very broad class of synchronous dataflow
graphs can be cleanly represented as a System of Affine Recurrence
Equations, thereby making them amenable to all of the scheduling and
optimization techniques that have been developed within the polyhedral
model.  The polyhedral model is a robust and well-established
framework within the scientific community, with methods for graph
parameterization, automatic parallelization, and storage optimization
that are very relevant to the current challenges within the signal
processing domain.  

Our analysis inputs a Phased Computation Graph, which we originally
formulated as a model of computation for StreamIt~\cite{streamitcc}.
Phased Computation Graphs are a generalization of synchronous dataflow
graphs, cyclo-static dataflow graphs, and computation graphs; they
also include a novel notion of initial and steady-state epochs, which
are an appealing abstraction for programmers.

We believe that the precise affine dependence framework provided by
the SARE representation will enable a powerful suite of node
optimizations in dataflow graphs.  We proposed optimizations such as
decimation propagation, node fission, and steady-state invariant code
motion that are a first step in this direction.
