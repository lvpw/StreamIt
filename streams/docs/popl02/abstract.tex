We present a translation scheme that allows a broad class of dataflow
graphs to be considered under the optimization framework of the
polyhedral model.  The input to our analysis is a Phased Computation
Graph, which we define as a generalization of the most widely used
dataflow representations, including synchronous dataflow, cyclo-static
dataflow, and computation graphs.  The output of our analysis is a
System of Affine Recurrence Equations (SARE) that exactly captures the
data dependences between the nodes of the original graph.  Using the
SARE representation, one can apply many techniques from the scientific
community that are new to the DSP domain.  For example, we propose
simple optimizations such as node splitting, decimation propagation,
and steady-state invariant code motion that leverage the fine-grained
dependence information of the SARE to perform novel transformations on a
stream graph.  We also propose ways in which the polyhedral model can
offer new approaches to classic problems of the DSP community, such as
minimizing buffer size, code size, and optimizing the schedule.
