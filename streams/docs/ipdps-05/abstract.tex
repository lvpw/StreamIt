Image and video codecs are prevalent in multimedia applications,
ranging from embedded systems, to desktop computers, to high-end
servers such as HDTV editing consoles. It is not uncommon however
that developers create (from scratch) and customize their codec
implementations for each of the architecture targets they intend their
coders and decoders to run on. This practice is time consuming and
error prone, leading to code that is not malleable or portable.  In
this paper we describe an implementation of the MPEG-2 codec using the
StreamIt programming language. StreamIt is an architecture-independent
stream language that aims to improve programmer productivity, while
concomitantly exposing the inherent parallelism and communication
topology of the application.  We describe why MPEG is a good match for
the streaming programming model, and illustrate the malleability of
the implementation in terms of quickly varying the degree of
parallelism that a developer can readily expose. StreamIt allows for
modular application development, which also reduces the complexity of
the debugging process since stream components can be verified
independently. This in turn leads to greater programmer productivity.
We implement a fully functional MPEG-2 decoder in StreamIt. The
decoder was developed in eight weeks by a single student programmer
who did not have any prior experience with MPEG or video codecs in
general. Many of the MPEG-2 components were subsequently reused to
assemble a JPEG codec.
