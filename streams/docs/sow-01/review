==================== REVIEWER 1 ====================
this paper mostly describes an API.  This paper would be interesting
if it showed how the particular API presented enabled various
optimizations and compiler techniques for stream processing programs.
Also, how does the compiler handle the notions of different *times*,
and the distinction between high and low volume channels (items 2 &3
in section 2)?
