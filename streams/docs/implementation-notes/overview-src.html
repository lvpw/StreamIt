<title>StreamIt Source Code Roadmap</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Package <b>at.dms</b> contains the DMS's Kopi compiler for Java with
the additions that form the StreamIt compilers.
Most of StreamIt the modifications for the compilers are in
<b>at.dms.kjc</b>, but <b>at.dms.util</b> also contains some StreamIt
code.
Note that the parser has been changed from parsing Java to parsing a
variant that requires sizes to be declared for all arrays.
</p>
<p>
Package <b>streamit</b> contains 
<ul>
<li>the code for the StreamIt interpreter
a.k.a. the library back end <b>streamit.library</b>.
</li><li> <b>streamit.frontend</b> which contains lexical analysis
and parsing of StreamIt code and conversion either into Java code for
the library back end, or into a variant of Java code annotated with
sizes for all array declarations suitable for the compier back ends.
</li><li> <b>streamit.eclipse</b> contains eclipse addons for graphical program
development and debugging.
</li><li> <b>streamit.scheduler2</b> contains scheduling code that
works both in the library and in the compiled back ends.
The scheduling relies on  <b>streamit.library.iriter</b> for iterating 
in the library and <b>at.dms.kjc.iterator</b> for iterating in the
compiler back ends.
</ul>
</p>
<p> 
Package <b>com.jgraph</b> appears obsolete and should be replaced with 
<b>org.jgraph</b>.  This third-party package is used only by the graph
editor eclipse add-on.
