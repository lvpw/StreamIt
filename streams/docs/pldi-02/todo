tabe

not going to happen:
--------------------

- do \mbox{ } around words in math.

- include picture of the equalizer in the intro?

- be consistent about SplitJoin / split-join / split join / splitjoin,
plus capitalization of all stream constructs.

- modify the tape-labeling diagram to have $n$ streams in a parallel split-join

things to do with paper:
------------------------

- note that push_A and pop_A have different tapes

things i'm not likely to do in paper
------------------------------------

- mention limitiation of first-class streams?

- define a max function in the case of the downstream message sending,
just for the sake of making the explanation clearer (and defining the
max function, so that other people can use it in other papers, and
think about the concept even.)

*** Can we figure out the denotational semantics for a feedback loop?

*** Can we show that fusion preserves the min function across its
inputs?

- Add a figure for the feedback loop transformation?  The fusion
transformation?

- Improve the translation from the abstract syntax back to a work function

- Can we say anything about how message latencies should be modified
following a fusion transformation?

- I think the min function is violated when the tapes are empty.
Should probably look at this and see if there's a way to fix it.

- Also, message constraints are violated when things are empty, since
if you require a certain amount of buffering between two filters, then
there won't be that data until initialization time.  hmm.

things to figure out / solve:
-----------------------------

* Add the meaning of the whole program to the denotational semantics.
