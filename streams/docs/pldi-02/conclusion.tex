\section{Conclusion}

We have implemented a prototype optimizing compiler for StreamIt: a
high-level stream language that aims to raise the abstraction level of
stream programming without sacrificing performance.  We have
demonstrated that the hierarchical structure imposed by the language
enables new compiler analyses and optimizations for the streaming
domain.  In particular, we believe that the stream dependence function
is a critical compiler representation for streaming applications,
comparable to distance and direction vectors for scientific
applications.

In all, we believe that optimizing compilers will be of immense
importance in the streaming domain.  Though our compiler cannot yet
match the performance of hand-coded applications, there is a ripe
field of optimizations that are enabled by the structured nature of
the stream programming model.  Moreover, it is a young domain where
languages and tools are lacking, but performance is very critical; the
developers that we have interacted with have been very eager to
explore new language and compiler solutions.  In an age when many are
skeptical of the utility of traditional compiler optimization, we hope
that the streaming domain proves to be an important frontier.
