Streaming programs represent an increasingly important and widespread
class of applications that holds unprecedented opportunities for
high-impact compiler technology.  Unlike sequential programs with
obscured dependence information and complex communication patterns, a
stream program is naturally written as a set of concurrent filters
with regular steady-state communication.  The StreamIt language aims
to provide a natural, high-level syntax that improves programmer
productivity in the streaming domain.  At the same time, the language
imposes a hierarchical structure on the stream graph that enables
novel representations and optimizations within the StreamIt compiler.
We define the ``stream dependence function'', a fundamental
relationship between the input channels of two filters in a stream
graph.  We also describe a suite of stream optimizations, a
denotational semantics for validating these optimizations, and a novel
phased scheduling algorithm for stream graphs.  In addition, we have
implemented a prototype of the StreamIt optimizing compiler that is
showing promising results.
