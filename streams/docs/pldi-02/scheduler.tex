Scheduling the order of the execution of filters has a large impact on 
the behavior of a StreamIt program.  In this section we introduce three
different scheduling techniques and analyze their properties.

\subsection{Periodic Schedule}
A schedule for a StreamIt program needs to satisfy a requirement that
a repeated execution of the schedule cannot lead to changed data
buffering between filters.  We call a schedule that satisfies this
requirement a periodic schedule.  (Here a schedule represents the
multiplicity of executions of filters, ignoring the ordering of these
executions.)

For every valid program, there exists a unique, minimal periodic
schedule.  Every other periodic schedule for a StreamIt program is a
multiple of the underlying periodic schedule \cite{bhat1994x3}.

While computing periodic schedules for StreamIt, we chose to preserve the
hierarchical structure presented in the program.

A filter has a periodic schedule of a single execution.  This is
because there are no scheduler-visible buffers inside of a filter.
All other components of the program express their periodic schedules
in terms of number of executions of their subcomponents necessary to
construct a valid schedule.  This technique relies on Theorem {\bf
???} to assure that the periodic schedule built is indeed the minimal
periodic schedule.

\subsection{Initialization Schedule}

Before we can execute any periodic schedule on a program, the program
may require intialization.  This is because we allow filters with
$peek_A$ values greater than their $pop_A$ values.  If the program is
not initialized, a filter that peeks more than it pops would not be
able to consume all the input provided for it during the first
execution of a periodic schedule.  The subsequent executions would
force the filter to consume the exact same amount of data, eventually
causing buffer overflow.

The initialization schedule is computed by ensuring that every filter $A$ has
at least $peek_A - pop_A$ unread data on its input tape available after 
initialization has been completed.

\subsection{Single Appearance Schedule}

A single appearance schedule (SAS) is a schedule in which every filter
and every structure appears exactly once.  Groups of filters and
structures can be combined together to form bigger structures.  In our
approach, we chose to perserve the structuring of the original program
when selecting structures to be grouped together.  Thus a schedule for
a given structure is a list of tuples of components included in this
structure and corresponding number of times each of these components
needs to be executed in a given periodic schedule. (Better results for
buffer size have been presented in \cite{somepaper}, they are however
within the same order of magnitude.)

As an example, the pipeline in Figure \ref{fig:sched} has a schedule
$(4A)(6B)(9C)(3D)$.  This schedule is represented in the left column of
Figure \ref{fig:sched}.

\subsection{Minimum Latency Scheduling}

In many streaming applications, there is an inherent delay between when data
is introduced into the system and when its results can be seen at the output
of the stream.  This delay is inherent to the structure of the particular
stream setup - in Figure \ref{fig:sched}, filter $B$ needs to be executed
three times before filter $D$ can output results directly dependent on the
second execution of filter $D$ (we may want to modify the figure to get a
better example here - I'd want to have first filter need to execute twice 
before the last filter can execute once).  Inherent latency can cause 
deadlocks in FeedbackLoops. 

A minimum latency schedule (MLS) is a schedule that, for every invocation
of the sink filter, minimizes number of invocations of all other filters.
This definition restrains the multiplicity of invocations of each filter, 
but it does not define the order of execution of these filters.

Developing a (MLS) is important because a SAS can easily introduce latency 
into FeedbackLoops that will cause the schedule to deadlock.  Our approach 
to building an MLS is hierarchical: for every stream component we construct
a cyclic schedule, consisting of a number of phases.  Each phase has the
property that it consists includes exactly one phase of the last downstream
component, and only the necessary number of more upstream components.
A filter has a cyclic schedule consisting only of its single invocation.

In Figure \ref{fig:sched}, the pipeline has a cyclic minimum latency
schedule consisting of three
phases: $\{A(2B)(3C)D\}$, $\{(2A)(2B)(3C)D\}$, $\{A(2B)(3C)D\}$.

\subsection{Minimum Buffer Scheduling}

Buffer size is closely related to latency.  The more data is buffered between
filters, the more delay there is between when data enters the computation
stream and when its results can be seen.  More importantly, however, buffer
sizes can grow exponentially with size of streaming program.

The buffer size requirement between any two filters is dictated solely
by the sequence of execution of these two filters.  The minimum buffer
size requirement is given by 

%$MinBuffer(A,B) = \frac{push_A pop_B}{gcd (push_A, pop_B)}}$ 
Due to \cite{murthy94combined}.

In our construction of a minimum buffer schedule, we again use the idea
of a cyclic schedule.  Phases of this schedule, however, are computed in
such a way, that every phase can have at most one phase of the upstream
most component that consumes data and one phase of the downstream most 
component that produces data.  The ordering of inner phases within a phase
matters here, so the schedule grows in size as compared to the minimum latency
schedule described above.  The technique used here is equivallent to pull
scheduling.  Because in each iteration this schedule only consumes as much 
data as necessary to produce an output, this schedule is also a minimum 
latency schedule.  

In Figure \ref{fig:sched}, the pipeline has a cyclic minimum buffer schedule
consisting of four phases: $\{AB(2C)BCD\}$, $\{AB(2C)\}$, $\{ABCD\}\{ABCD\}$.

\subsection{Schedule Comparison}

Let $children_A$ be the number of subcomponents contained in component $A$.
Let $child_{i, A}$ be the $i$th subcomponent contained in component $A$.
