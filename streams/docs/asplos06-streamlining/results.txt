Results:

Characteristics of the benchmarks
* filters
* splits
* joins
* comp/comm
* % stateless
* longest path from source to sink
* shortest path from source to sink
* description
* differentiation from previous publications
* filters that peek?

relative weight of phases of mpeg
what are the mpegs doing?
is DCT a subet of one of the mpegs?
why multiple runs of some benchmarks?
  remove the duplicates that are not fundamentally different

  
Comparison between thread, thread + dup, space, streamlined (maybe with dup)
* throughput
* latency (thread and space would be lowest) (just talk about)
* Graph normalized to thread baseline (with average bar)

Show for 1-3 of benchmarks robustness to change in parameters vs other backends.

Hard buffersize numbers:
This will fit in a compute node or L2, but why do we go off chip


Take home points:

Explanations:
Describing outliers and general trends


GranAdj
 show throughput and buffer size decrease (not exactly equal to commuication, but not for...)
 try to show that it might reduce it to L2?

Bandwidth?

Space-time pipelining?	 

Duplication for streamlining?  Low priority

Raw 1x1  to establish the thread baseline.
