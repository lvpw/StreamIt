These capabilities enable a programmer to write an application and its
filters at a natural granularity that is independent of
parallelization considerations enabling portable, reusable, and
malleable code.  Furthermore, fine-grained implementations of filters
enables the compiler to perform guided filter fusion that balances
data and instruction cache behavior~\cite{sermulins-lctes05}.


Need to address the coarsening issue.  Brook, which disallows state
would force the user to just coarsen the filter.  Why wouldn't someone
just coarsen?
