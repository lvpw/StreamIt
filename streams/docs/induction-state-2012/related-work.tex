The process of eliminating traditional induction variables has been
extensively researched~\cite{Bacon:1994,RM99:RRV}.  These particular
optimizations help eliminate instructions by redefining all induction
variables in terms of a single induction variable.  Many automatically
parallelizing compiler systems, including Rice Fortran D
~\cite{Hiranandani:1992}, SUIF ~\cite{Wilson:1994}, Polaris
~\cite{Blume:1996}, have also done work to automatically eliminate
such traditional induction variables.

Data parallelism is an important class of parallelism that many stream
programming languages attempt to expose.  Other streaming languages
attempt to expose data parallelism that may be inhibited by state in
different ways.  Brook~\cite{brook04} in particular disallows stateful
programs, thus allowing for extensive data parallelism.



These capabilities enable a programmer to write an application and its
filters at a natural granularity that is independent of
parallelization considerations enabling portable, reusable, and
malleable code.  Furthermore, fine-grained implementations of filters
enables the compiler to perform guided filter fusion that balances
data and instruction cache behavior~\cite{sermulins-lctes05}.


Need to address the coarsening issue.  Brook, which disallows state
would force the user to just coarsen the filter.  Why wouldn't someone
just coarsen?
