overall:
* better introductions for sections ex, "in this section...", "contribution"
* better introduce the concept of an initialization and steady-state schedule
* move the analysis section to before the mpeg2 case study, add the tables for the other benchmarks to this section.

* describe figure 3 in the "iteration state section"
* put concrete examples in section 3 that illustrate the problem with state, in that it prevents parallelization, maybe the mpeg2 encoding number.  

* first paragraph of section iv, not the paradigm, programmer should not have to worry about data parallelism
* need a better description of the iter keyword
* induction variable elimination?

* combine sections IV and V, maybe begin with text from section 5.
* need to better introduce and describe code figures

Fission section:
* discuss how the initialization and steady-state schedule are required for the transformation, because we might know how the iterations of the original fliter are distributed.
* start a subsection for the mulitpler handling

Need conclusion
