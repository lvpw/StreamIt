FIRBankPipeline contains one filter that uses induction variable state with 3.94\% of program's work.   Figure~\ref{fig:firbank-results} indicates the speedups over 1 core for both stateful and stateless implementations.  Between stateful and stateless implementations, there is 1.35X speedup on 8 cores, 1.58X speedup on 16 cores, and 1.84X speedup on 32 cores, which abides fairly closely to the model.
