                  applications. Previously, it has been demonstrated that for graphical programs based on the widely-used synchronous dataflow model
                  an important class of minimum code size implementations can be viewed as parenthesizations of lexical orderings of the computational
                  blocks. Such a parenthesization corresponds to the hierarchy of loops in the software implementation. In this paper, we present a
                  dynamic programming technique for constructing a parenthesization that minimizes data memory cost from a given lexical ordering of a
                  synchronous dataflow graph. For graphs that do not contain delays, this technique always constructs a parenthesization that has
                  minimum data memory cost from among all parenthesizations for the given lexical ordering. When delays are present, the technique may
                  make refinements to the lexical ordering while it is computing the parenthesization, and the data memory cost of the result is
                  guaranteed to be less than or equal to the data memory cost of all valid parenthesizations for the initial lexical ordering},

                  appearance schedules, for a certain class of SDF graphs. In addition, algorithms and heuristics are presented that generate single

                  appropriate architectures for implementing the graph. Conventional models for timing suffer from shortcomings that make it difficult
                  to represent timing information in a hierarchical manner, especially for multirate signal processing systems. We identify some of

                  systems similarly to single rate systems. Several analytical results such as the computation of the iteration period bound, that

                  characteristics, which communicate and interact in a variety of ways-synchronous or asynchronous, buffered or unbuffered,
                  etc. Obviously, when designing such systems, a modeling language needs to reflect this heterogeneity. Today's modeling environments
                  usually offer a variant of what we call amorphous heterogeneity to address this problem. This paper argues that modeling systems in
                  this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyze interactions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a more structured
                  approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity, to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semantic
                  framework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses the issues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the
                  desire for component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism as a way to address these issues.},

                  done for different measures of storage capacity. The problem is known to be NP-complete and because of this, existing buffer
                  minimisation techniques are heuristics and hence not exact. Modern model-checking tools are quite efficient and they have been
                  successfully applied to scheduling-related problems. We study the feasibility of this approach with examples.},

  abstract =	 {Large-grain synchronous dataflow graphs or multi-rate graphs have the distinct feature that the nodes of the dataflow graph fire at
                  different rates. Such multi-rate large-grain dataflow graphs have been widely regarded as a powerful programming model for DSP
                  applications. In this paper we propose a method to minimize buffer storage requirement in constructing rate-optimal compile-time
                  (MBRO) schedules for multi-rate dataflow graphs. We demonstrate that the constraints to minimize buffer storage while executing at
                  the optimal computation rate (i.e. the maximum possible computation rate without storage constraints) can be formulated as a unified
                  linear programming problem in our framework. A novel feature of our method is that in constructing the rate-optimal schedule, it
                  directly minimizes the memory requirement by choosing the schedule time of nodes appropriately. Lastly, a new circular-arc interval
                  graph coloring algorithm has been proposed to further reduce the memory requirement by allowing buffer sharing among the arcs of the
                  multi-rate dataflow graph.},

                  in a high level streaming language to either software or hardware implementations. The compiler uses a hierarchical compilation
                  strategy that separates concerns between macro- and micro-functional requirements. Macro-functional concerns address how components
                  (modules) are assembled to implement larger more complex applications. Micro-functional issues deal with synthesis issues of the
                  module internals. Optimus thus allows software developers who lack deep hardware design expertise to transparently leverage the
                  advantages of hardware customization without crossing the semantic gap between high level languages and hardware description
                  languages. Optimus generates streaming hardware that achieves on average 40x speedup over our baseline embedded processor for a
                  fraction of the energy. Additionally, our results show that streaming-specific optimizations can further improve performance by
                  255\% and reduce the area requirements by 16\% in average. These designs are competitive with {Handel-C} implementations for some of

  abstract =	 {Digital signal processing (DSP) applications involve processing long streams of input data. It is important to take into account
                  this form of processing when implementing embedded software for DSP systems. Task-level vectorization, or block processing, is a
                  useful dataflow graph transformation that can significantly improve execution performance by allowing subsequences of data items to
                  be processed through individual task invocations. In this way, several benefits can be obtained, including reduced context switch
                  overhead, increased memory locality, improved utilization of processor pipelines, and use of more efficient DSP-oriented addressing
                  modes. On the other hand, block processing generally results in increased memory requirements since it effectively increases the
                  sizes of the input and output values associated with processing tasks. In this paper, we investigate the memory-performance tradeoff
                  associated with block processing. We develop novel block processing algorithms that take carefully take into account memory
                  constraints to achieve efficient block processing configurations within given memory space limitations. Our experimental results
                  indicate that these methods derive optimal memory-constrained block processing solutions most of the time. We demonstrate the
                  advantages of our block processing techniques on practical kernel functions and applications in the DSP domain},

  title =	 {Orchestrating the execution of stream programs on multicore platforms},
  abstract =	 {While multicore hardware has become ubiquitous, explicitly parallel programming models and compiler techniques for exploiting
                  parallelism on these systems have noticeably lagged behind. Stream programming is one model that has wide applicability in the
                  multimedia, graphics, and signal processing domains. Streaming models execute as a set of independent actors that explicitly
                  communicate data through channels. This paper presents a compiler technique for planning and orchestrating the execution of
                  streaming applications on multicore platforms. An integrated unfolding and partitioning step based on integer linear programming is
                  presented that unfolds data parallel actors as needed and maximally packs actors onto cores. Next, the actors are assigned to
                  pipeline stages in such a way that all communication is maximally overlapped with computation on the cores. To facilitate
                  experimentation, a generalized code generation template for mapping the software pipeline onto the Cell architecture is
                  presented. For a range of streaming applications, a geometric mean speedup of 14.7x is achieved on a 16-core Cell platform compared
                  to a single core.},

                  Cocentric. Good synthesis from an SDF specification depends crucially on scheduling, and memory is an important metric for
                  generating efficient schedules. Previous techniques on memory minimization have either not considered buffer sharing at all, or have
                  done so at a fairly coarse level (the meaning of this will be made more precise in the Article). In this Article, we develop a
                  buffer overlaying strategy that works at the level of an input/output edge pair of an actor. It works by algebraically encapsulating
                  the lifetimes of the tokens on the input/output edge pair, and determines the maximum amount of the input buffer space that can be
                  reused by the output. We develop the mathematical basis for performing merging operations, and develop several algorithms and
                  heuristics for using the merging technique for generating efficient implementations. We show improvements of up to 48\&percnt; over

  abstract =	 {Signal flow graphs with dataflow semantics have been used in signal processing system simulation, algorithm development, and
                  real-time system design. Dataflow semantics implicitly expose function parallelism by imposing only a partial ordering constraint on
                  the execution of functions. One particular form of dataflow called synchronous dataflow (SDF) has been quite popular in programming
                  environments for digital signal processing (DSP) since it has strong formal properties and is ideally suited for expressing
                  multirate DSP algorithms. However, SDF and other dataflow models use first-in first-out (FIFO) queues on the communication channels
                  and are thus ideally suited only for one-dimensional (1-D) signal processing algorithms. While multidimensional systems can also be
                  expressed by collapsing arrays into 1-D streams, such modeling is often awkward and can obscure potential data parallelism that
                  might be present. SDF can be generalized to multiple dimensions; this model is called multidimensional synchronous dataflow
                  (MDSDF). This paper presents MDSDF and shows how MDSDF can be efficiently used to model a variety of multidimensional DSP systems,
                  as well as other types of systems that are not modeled elegantly in SDF. However, MDSDF generalizes the FIFO queues used in SDF to
                  arrays and, thus, is capable only of expressing systems sampled on rectangular lattices. This paper also presents a generalization
                  of MDSDF that is capable of handling arbitrary sampling lattices and lattice-changing operations such as nonrectangular decimation
                  and interpolation. An example of a practical system is given to show the usefulness of this model. The key challenge in generalizing
                  the MDSDF model is preserving static schedulability, which eliminates the overhead associated with dynamic scheduling, and
                  preserving a model where data parallelism, as well as functional parallelism, is fully explicit},

                  signal processing work system (SPW) from Cadence, and COSSAP from Synopsys. The block diagram languages used in these environments
                  are usually based on dataflow semantics because various subsets of dataflow have proven to be good matches for expressing and

                  expressing multirate signal processing systems. One of the key problems that arises during synthesis from an SDF specification is
                  scheduling. Past work on scheduling from SDF has focused on optimization of program memory and buffer memory under a model that did
                  not exploit sharing opportunities. In this paper, we build on our previously developed analysis and optimization framework for
                  looped schedules to formally tackle the problem of generating optimally compact schedules for SDF graphs. We develop techniques for
                  computing these optimally compact schedules in a manner that also attempts to minimize buffering memory under the assumption that
                  buffers will be shared. This results in schedules whose data memory usage is drastically lower than methods in the past have
                  achieved. The method we use is that of lifetime analysis; we develop a model for buffer lifetimes in SDF graphs and develop
                  scheduling algorithms that attempt to generate schedules that minimize the maximum number of live tokens under the particular buffer
                  lifetime model. We develop several efficient algorithms for extracting the relevant lifetimes from the SDF schedule. We then use the
                  well-known first-fit heuristic for packing arrays efficiently into memory. We report extensive experimental results on applying
                  these techniques to several practical SDF systems and show improvements that average 50\% over previous techniques, with some
                  systems exhibiting up to an 83\% improvement over previous techniques },

  abstract =	 {We present a new design environment, called System Canvas, targeted at DSP and telecommunication system designs. Our environment
                  uses an easy-to-use block-diagram syntax to specify systems at a very high level of abstraction. The block diagram syntax is based
                  on formal semantics, and uses a number of different models of computation including cyclo-static dataflow, dynamic dataflow, and a
                  discrete-event model. A key feature of our tool is that the user does not need to have an awareness of which model is being used;
                  the models can be freely mixed and matched and a simulation can consist of an arbitrary combination of models. The blocks are
                  written in `C'or `C++' and it is straightforward to write custom blocks and incorporate them into custom libraries. Other key
                  features include the ability to control simulations via language-neutral scripts, and a powerful optimization engine that enables
                  optimization of the system over arbitrarily specified parameters, constraints, and cost functions. Fixed-point analysis capability
                  allows any signal or variable in the system to be set to any type of number system before the simulation proceeds. The tool is
                  available on the Windows NT platform and incorporates modern and ubiquitous Windows GUI look and feel.},

  abstract =	 {We compare synchronous dataflow (SDF) and cyclo-static dataflow (CSDF), which are each special cases of a model of computation we
                  call dataflow process networks. In SDF actors have static firing rules: they consume and produce a fixed number of data tokens in
                  each firing. This model is well suited to multirate signal processing applications and lends itself to efficient static scheduling,
                  avoiding the run-time scheduling overhead incurred by general implementations of process networks. In CSDF which is a generalization
                  of SDF actors have cyclically changing firing rules. In some situations, the added generality of CSDF can unnecessarily complicate
                  the scheduling. We show how higher-order functions can be used to transform a CSDF graph into a SDF graph, simplifying the
                  scheduling problem. In other situations, CSDF has a genuine advantage over SDF: simpler precedence constraints. We show how this
                  makes it possible to eliminate unnecessary computations and expose additional parallelism. We use digital sample rate conversion as
                  an example to illustrate these advantages of CSDF. },

                  overview of the historical development of stream processing and a detailed discussion of the different languages and techniques for
                  programming with streams that can be found in the literature. This includes an analysis of dataflow, specialized  functional and
                  logic programming with streams, reactive systems, signal processing systems, and the use of streams in the design and verification
                  of hardware. The aim of this survey is an analysis of the development of each of these specialized topics to determine if a general
                  theory of stream processing has emerged. As such, we discuss and classify the different classes of stream processing systems found
                  in the literature from the perspective of programming primitives, implementation techniques, and computability issues, including a
                  comparison of the semantic models that are used to formalize stream based computation. },

  abstract = {The halt in clock frequency scaling has forced architects and language designers to look elsewhere for continued improvements in performance. We believe that extracting maximum performance will require compilation to highly heterogeneous architectures that include reconfigurable hardware. We present a new language, Lime, which is designed to be executable across a broad range of architectures, from FPGAs to conventional CPUs. We present the language as a whole, focusing on its novel features for limiting side-effects and integration of the streaming paradigm into an object- oriented language. We conclude with some initial results demonstrating applications running either on a CPU or co- executing on a CPU and an FPGA.}
