The utilization metric includes pipeline stalls due to cache accesses
and hazards for each tile.  Each RAW tile is a single-issue, inorder
processor.  Stalls are frequent.

Utilization should not be compared between space multiplexing and
SpaceTime multiplexing because space multiplexing adds compute
instructions necessary to implement filter fusion (the data buffering
and redistribution of fused filters mapped to a single node). In
SpaceTime this is achieved using the communication networks.  A
throughput comparison makes more sense.
