\section{Compiler Flow} 

In the SpaceTime Compiler, we first convert the StreamIt graph into to
a flat, non-hierarchical graph with unnecessary communication channels
removed.  Our compiler then extracts the slices from the stream
graph, considering the concurrency, communication, and work load of
the filters (Section \ref{sec:extract}).  Next, we schedule the
slices, producing both a multi-stage initialization schedule and a
software-pipelined steady-state schedule (Section
\ref{sec:scheduling}).  Lastly, we generate both communication and
computation code.
