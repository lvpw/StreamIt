\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We have implemented a fully-automated scheduler that uses space-time
multiplexing in the StreamIt compiler.  The scheduler includes all of
the transformations and optimizations discussed in this paper.  We
evaluate our compiler using the suite of streaming applications shown
in Figure \ref{fig:benchmarks}.  The performance results for running
each application on the Raw architecture is shown in Table
\ref{tab:results}.
