- mention our view of an atomic cache miss (atomatically loads a workingset on a miss)?

- fix spacing for all figures and tables; style file draws a line (?) above the caption: remove all box frames if possible
- inline appendix into the text and remove appendix
- add a conclusion
- check acknowledgment
- add a roadmap? (currently forward section pointers inlined in the intro)
- fix FIR (the word) in Figure 2
- fix font in Figures 9-11


- results:  did we  only apply  scalar replacement  in  CAF+buffer and
CAF+buffer+optimizations? we should be more specific.

> other things to consider adding:

- results with modulation
- what is the right peek scaling number
- change 90/10 rule to equalize *amount* of work in steady state
- provide evidence that our cache model makes sense
- at least a cursory investigation with/comparison to phased scheduling
- better explanation of results, especially scalar replacement and 
register allocation impact (need to verify our hypothesis)
