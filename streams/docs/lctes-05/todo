- results:  did we  only apply  scalar replacement  in  CAF+buffer and
CAF+buffer+optimizations? we should be more specific.

> other things to consider adding:

- results with modulation
- evidence that our cache model makes sense
- at least a cursory investigation with/comparison to phased scheduling
- better explanation of results, especially scalar replacement and 
register allocation impact (need to verify our hypothesis)
