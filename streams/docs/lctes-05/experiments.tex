\section{Experimental Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

- summary graph four bars:
  - baseline: no fusion, best unrolling
  - only fusion + partitioning
  - only multiplicity
  - fusion + multiplicity (best cacheopt line)

- cacheopt details
  - try different unrolling factors as baseline
  - should demonstrate that cacheopt + full unrolling does as well as
    any baseline unrolling factor
  - argue that this demonstrates robustness re: choosing an unrolling factor

- fusion details (time permitting)
  - separate effects of:
     - stack reuse
     - scalar replacement
     - peek scaling
