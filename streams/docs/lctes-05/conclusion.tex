\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

- parallelism in stream graph can be exploited for caching

- simple optimization: execution scaling

- cache-aware fusion

- due to static nature of work 
- scalar replacement
- copy-shift

- actually helps you to increase the size of data in buffers, but not
  by too much
