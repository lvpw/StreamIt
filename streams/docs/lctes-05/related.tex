- need to make the point that while there is a lot of work on
  scheduling SDF graphs that tradeoff buffer size and code size, they
  are mostly geared toward minimizing them which is not a good
  decision from the point of view of a cache based architecture
  (compiling for on chip RAM and scratchpad memories is different).
  here we are actualy scaling up code size and buffer size for better
  performance. 

- filter fusion and interleaving

(cache models?)
