- need to make the point that while there is a lot of work on
  scheduling SDF graphs that tradeoff buffer size and code size, they
  are mostly geared toward minimizing them which is not a good
  decision from the point of view of a cache based architecture
  (compiling for on chip RAM and scratchpad memories is different).
  here we are actualy scaling up code size and buffer size for better
  performance. 

Proebsting and Watterson \cite{pro96} give a fusion algorithm that
interleaves the control flow graphs of adjacent filters.  However,
their algorithm only supports synchronous {\tt get} and {\tt put}
operations; StreamIt's {\tt peek} operation necessitates buffer
management between filters.
