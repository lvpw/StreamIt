\section{Cache Optimizations}
\label{sec:cache-opt}

In this section we describe two cache aware optimizations that
are geared toward improving the cache behavior of streaming programs. First, we
describe {\it execution scaling} which 
scales a steady state to improve instruction locality, subject to the
data working set constraints of the actors in the stream graph.
Second, we describe {\it cache aware fusion} which performs a series
of granularity adjustments to the actors in the steady state. The
fusion serves to $(i)$ reduce
the overhead of switching between actors, $(ii)$ create coarser
grained actors for execution scaling, and $(iii)$ enable novel
buffer management techniques between fused actors (see Section~\ref{sec:buffer}).
