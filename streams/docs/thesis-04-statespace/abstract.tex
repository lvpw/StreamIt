    Digital devices and their underlying DSP technology are
widespread in modern society. Consequently, optimizing DSP
applications is necessary to satisfy tight power, space, and
bandwidth constraints. As code length and complexity increases for
these applications, the value of time-intensive, manual expert
analysis has decreased. In its place, robust, compiler-generated
optimizations have become necessary.

    We target linear state-space sections of applications to
analyze and optimize, and use the programming language StreamIt to
implement and test our ideas. StreamIt enables its users to create
filters and connect them in a simple, structured manner. A linear
state-space filter may have a set of state variables that it uses
from execution to execution. Such a filter has the property that
its outputs are a linear combination of its inputs and states, and
the states are updated by a linear combination of the inputs and
states. Examples of such filters that use states include IIR
filters and linear difference equations.

    We automate the following steps in the StreamIt compiler. We
extract the representation for each filter that is linear
state-space. We combine representations of filters to form a
single linear state-space filter. We remove unnecessary states and
reduce the number of computations needed per filter execution.
Lastly, we convert the optimized filter back to StreamIt code.

    We have compiled a number of StreamIt benchmark applications
using our analysis and optimizations. Our data indicates
state-space replacement works as well as linear replacement (a
filter is linear if its outputs are an affine combination of its
inputs) for stateless filters, and improves performance by as much
as 66\% for combinations of filters with state.
