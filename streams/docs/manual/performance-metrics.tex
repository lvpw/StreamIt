\section{Measuring StreamIt Performance}
\subsection{Introduction}
{\huge This section is slightly out of date -- there is a new number
gathering infrastructure that Gordo made.} 

To use the new infrastructure, run the compiler with the {\tt
--numbers <n>} option, where {\tt <n>} represents the number of
steady-state cycles that should be measured.  Then find your results
in the {\tt results.out} file.  For manual number gathering, you might find
use for some of the {\tt btl} commands described in this section.

This section is intended to introduce people how to measure the performance
of StreamIt programs.


\subsection{Performance on RAW}
\subsubsection{\textit{btl} Simulator Setup}
To be done.

\subsubsection{Running the compiler}
The actual command to run the compiler is 
\begin{verbatim}java -Xmx512M  at.dms.kjc.Main -s MyProgram.java\end{verbatim}

If you have copied a \texttt{.cshrc} file from someone else in the
StreamIt group, you mist likely have the above command aliased to \texttt{s}
so the above can be run using the following shorthand notation:
\begin{verbatim}s MyProgram.java\end{verbatim}

There are also a number of options, which control optimizations,
which I will elucidate here because they are not written up anywhere
else that I can find.
\begin{description}
\item [-c or --constprop] Turns on FIELD propagation.
\item [-a or --partition] Turns on auto partitioning
\item [-o or --fusion] Fuses the entire stream into one gigantic filter
\item [-u] Turns on loop unrolling (which is unnecessary as it is run with fieldprop automatically)
\item [-k] Turns on sync removal
\item [-x] Turns on rate matching. Doesn't actually exist (eg don't use this option)
\item [-S] Uses the old partitioner/fuser (ostensibly)
\end{description}


\subsubsection{Running the simulator}
To run the RAW program that the StreamIt compiler just created
you can type 

\begin{verbatim}make -f Makefile.streamit run\end{verbatim}

This command will cause the simulator to boot up, execute the startup code
and then run for a bunch of cycles. If you want to quit before the 
simulation is done, use CTL-C. 

Output from the simulator should look something like the following:
\begin{verbatim}
[03: 000034de8]: 0
[03: 000037ab4]: 0
[03: 00003a74a]: 0
[03: 00003d44a]: 0
[03: 0000400d3]: 0
[03: 000042d1c]: 0
[03: 000045998]: 1
[03: 0000485d2]: 1
[03: 00004b248]: 1
[03: 00004de94]: 2
[03: 000050b08]: 2
\end{verbatim}

The first number (03) represents the fact that the tile at row 0, column 3
issued the print command. The next number 
(eg 000034de8) is the cycle count (in hexadecimal) at which the third number was produced. The 
third number is the output value that is produced by your program.

\subsubsection{Running in debug mode}
To run the simulator in interactive debug mode, you should run
\begin{verbatim}make -f Makefile.streamit debug\end{verbatim}

Which will bring up a ``shunt'' window which looks something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
Configuration: 

[THREAD   DEVICE NAME    RESET ROUTINE          CALC ROUTINE           PARAM   ]

[0816d010 Serial Rom     dev_serial_rom_reset   dev_serial_rom_calc    08105880]
[084230a0 Print Service  dev_print_service_rese dev_print_service_calc 0816a720]
[08420e48 DRAM           dev_dram_reset         dev_dram_calc          08426068]
[08455c70 DRAM           dev_dram_reset         dev_dram_calc          0842a4d0]
[08445000 DRAM           dev_dram_reset         dev_dram_calc          0841efc0]
[0842bcf8 DRAM           dev_dram_reset         dev_dram_calc          0843fe68]
[08420708 Quick Print De dev_quick_print_reset  dev_quick_print_calc   08424fa0]

// Use VMShowPositionOfThread(THREAD #); to inspect execution of device 

/*[0] 0*/ 
\end{verbatim}

by typing 

\begin{verbatim}go();\end{verbatim}

you can start the simulator, which will then boot up the raw processor,  
bring your program into memory, and perform any other initialization tasks 
that it needs to do.

After initialiation (which takes time proportional to the amount of code
that needs to be loaded into raw) you will get a message and a prompt much like

\begin{verbatim}
/*[0] 0*/ go();
running...
// [ serial rom : finished tile.rbf --> static port 15 ]
// *** interrupted [13756/inf]
stopped.
/*[2129249] 1*/ 
\end{verbatim}

You are now ready to start doing useful things with the debugger.

\paragraph{go();}
If you simply run the \texttt{go();} command, you will set the simulator executing, 
without any limit as to how many cycles it will run.

If you want to stop the simulator, you can hit CTL-C in the main window (not the
shunt window), which will give you the command prompt back in the shunt window.

\paragraph{step(xxxxx);}
By running the \texttt{step(xxxxx);} command, you will step the simulator 
forward xxxxx cycles. At the end of that many cycles, the simulator 
will stop executing and return you to a command prompt.

By stepping the simulator xxxxx cycles, each processor (of the 16) is stepped
forward xxxxx cycles.

\paragraph{sv(xxxxx);}
By running the \texttt{sv();} command, you will generate the much vaunted
bloodgraph that is the proverbial bread and butter of the StreamIt performance
SWAT team. The simulator will run the program for xxxxx cycles, and then
emit a bloodgraph that graphically depicts the program's state during those
xxxxx cycles. (The bloodgraph is displayed using an external call to \textit{xv}).

Also of interest is the \texttt{workCount} line that is displayed. The
following line was generated by running \textit{sv(500);}.

\begin{verbatim}workCount = 6865 / 8000\end{verbatim}

The first number is the number of useful work cycles that the raw chip did. The second
number is the total number of cycles available to the program.

There is a subtlety involved. The total available cycles will be exactly $16*xxxxx$ where 
xxxxx is the number of cycles that sv was run with (eg \texttt{sv(xxxxx);}). This
corresponds to the fact that there are 16 tiles on raw and each was run for xxxxx cycles.
However, if a tile is not doing useful work (eg StreamIt did assign it any code)
all of the xxxxx cycles for that tile are reported as doing ``useful'' work, while this is
clearly not the case. 

If you want to know how many tiles are not in use, you can either examine the 
layout file generated by the StreamIt compiler (\textit{layout.dot}) or you
can look at the bloodgraph. Any tile that shows up as totally white (no green or anything) is
not actually doing useful work (it must be sitting in some sort of busy loop,
or executing \texttt{NOP}s or something.

\paragraph{count\_FLOPS(xxxxx);}
If you want to know how many floating point operations (FLOPS) your 
program performed, you can use the \texttt{count\_FLOPS(xxxxx);} command which will 
count FLOPS that are executed over xxxxx cycles. It should produce a line such as

\begin{verbatim}// **** count_FLOPS: 7006 FLOPS,   64 mFLOPS\end{verbatim}

the first number, 7006 FLOPS is the actual number of FLOPS that occurred. The second
number, 64 mFLOPS, is actually millions of floating point operations \textbf{per second};
which is calculated from FLOPS by using $(FLOPS/xxxxx) * 250$ because
the raw processor is running at 250 MHz.


\paragraph{Quitting \textit{btl}}
When you are done with the interactive debugger, use the command

\begin{verbatim}quit();\end{verbatim}

to stop the debugger and return you to the command prompt.

Incidentally, typing CTL-D will close the annoying shunt window.

\subsubsection{Hacking \texttt{Makefile.streamit}}
The most useful way to hack the makefile produced by the compiler,
\texttt{Makefile.streamit}, is to add a line such as the following to it:

\begin{verbatim}SIM-COMMAND = sv(216552); sv(11468); sv(11414);\end{verbatim}

Which you should put right under \texttt{LIMIT} and \texttt{SIM-CYCLES}
command in the Makefile.
\begin{verbatim}
LIMIT = TRUE
SIM-CYCLES = 500000
SIM-COMMAND = sv(216552); sv(11468); sv(11414); 
\end{verbatim}

Defining the \texttt{SIM-COMMAND} variable in your Makefile.streamit and 
then running the simulator with 

\begin{verbatim}make -f Makefile.streamit run\end{verbatim}

will cause the simulator to execute the commands in \texttt{SIM-COMMAND}
in batch mode and then quit. This is useful when trying to automate
the collection of bloodgraphs and FLOPS counts (see below).




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% How to Measure Performance %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsubsection{Determining Performance}
The following subsection describes (hopefully in enough detail) how
to determine throughput, utilization, and MFLOPS for a StreamIt program
while causing the least possible pain to the measurer.

\paragraph{Determining the StreamIt Steady State}
The critical part of measuring performance is to determine how many cycles
it takes a program to enter the steady state and then how many cycles
it takes for each steady state iteration. When we say steady state and steady
state iteration we are talking about the StreamIt notion of steady state: the
smallest number of cycles that it takes to start the same pattern again.

To date we have been relying on the StreamIt output that is produced 
to delineate the steady state cycles. Typically, using our knowledge of
the algorithm or using the Java Library (with -i 1) we have determined the
number of outputs that gets produced by a single steady state iteration, let's call
it $N$.

To account for the startup cost of getting the StreamIt program running on
the simulator, we have typically looked for cycle that the program produces
the $N$th output, the $2N$th output and the $3N$th output, call them $x$, $y$ and $z$. 
Armed with these numbers we can calculate the throughput, and instrument
\texttt{Makefile.streamit} to produce bloodgraphs, utilization, and MFLOPS very easily. 

\paragraph{Throughput} 
With just $x$, $y$ and $z$ we can figure out the throughput. We have been reporting
throughput as output per $10^5$ cycles. Therefore, given that the program produces
$N$ outputs, throughput is given either by $(N/(y-x))(100000)$ or $(N/(z-y))(100000)$.
These two numbers represent the throughput per 100000 cycles for the second and third
steady state iteration, respectively. There are sometimes discrepancies between the two 
numbers, and in this case we average the results.

The source of these discrepencies is not known, but it probably has something to do with
the way that stalls effect the processor pipelines, or possibly with how long it takes to
print different length outputs.

\paragraph{Bloodgraph and Utilization} 
If we supplement \texttt{Makefile.streamit} with the following line, as described above,
we can get the bloodgraphs for the first three steady state iterations of
our program.
\begin{verbatim}SIM-COMMAND = sv(x); sv(y); sv(z);\end{verbatim} 

When we run using the augmented Makefile, three blood graphs should appear, 
corresponding to the first, second and third steady state iterations.
Also produced should be \texttt{workCount}s for all three iterations, which
should look something like:
\begin{verbatim}
workCount = 490843 / 497360
// (xv -rotate 270 -hflip /tmp/file5YCnNd; rm /tmp/file5YCnNd ) &
[00: 00000796d]: 1
workCount = 432983 / 436752
// (xv -rotate 270 -hflip /tmp/fileCafZiF; rm /tmp/fileCafZiF ) &
[00: 00000e40e]: 1
workCount = 432983 / 436752
// (xv -rotate 270 -hflip /tmp/filedJvo9H; rm /tmp/filedJvo9H ) &
\end{verbatim} 

Averaging the final two work counts should give you a reasonable estimate for
the steady state utilization of RAW. \textit{Note you might have to adjust your calculations
to account for unused tiles.}

\paragraph{MFLOPS} 
You can use \texttt{count\_FLOPS} to get the FLOPS and mFLOPS as described above. To get more
significant figures for mFLOPS than provided, you can do the MFLOP calculation by hand. I found it
helpful to replace the \texttt{sv} in \texttt{Makefile.streamit} with \texttt{count\_FLOPS} and then look
at the output for the utilization.

Put a line in \texttt{Makefile.streamit} that looks something like:
\begin{verbatim}SIM-COMMAND = count\_FLOPS(x); count\_FLOPS(y); count\_FLOPS(z);\end{verbatim} 


And the output produced should look something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
// **** count_FLOPS: 7181 FLOPS,   57 mFLOPS
[00: 00000796d]: 1
// **** count_FLOPS: 7006 FLOPS,   64 mFLOPS
[00: 00000e40e]: 1
// **** count_FLOPS: 7006 FLOPS,   64 mFLOPS
\end{verbatim}

Note that the FLOPS for the first steady state iteration is different -- 
it includes the startup costs associated with getting the filters going. Normally the best 
way to proceed is to average the mFLOPS numbers from the second and
third iterations (if they differ).

\paragraph{Advanced MFLOPS counting}
If you are hacking your own program from either C or assembly, 
the following the code (called a \textit{bc} device for some reason) implements count\_FLOPS.
This might be useful if you wish to measure performance of an analogous non-streamit
program executing on raw, for instance.

\begin{verbatim}
global gFLOPS = 0;
fn __clock_handler(hms)
{
  local i;
  for (i = 0; i < gNumProc; i++)
  {
    gFLOPS += imem_instr_is_fpu(get_imem_instr(i, get_pc_for_proc(i)));
  }
}

EventManager_RegisterHandler("clock", "__clock_handler");

fn count_FLOPS(steps)
{
  gFLOPS = 0;
  step(steps);
  printf("// **** count_FLOPS: %4d FLOPS, %4d mFLOPS
",
         gFLOPS, (250*gFLOPS)/steps);
}


\end{verbatim}

# pull these in from the simulator -- get it to print only once
# for each iteration.
my $first_iter = "0x000034de8";
my $second_iter = "0x000037ab4";
my $third_iter = "0x00003a74a";

my $dec_first_iter = hex($first_iter);

my $dec_third_iter = hex($third_iter);

my $delta_one = ($dec_second_iter - $dec_first_iter);
my $delta_two = ($dec_third_iter - $dec_second_iter);

print "first  iteration done at $first_iter ($dec_first_iter cycles)\n";
print "second iteration done at $second_iter ($dec_second_iter cycles)".
  " (delta=$delta_one)\n";
print "third  iteration done at $third_iter ($dec_third_iter cycles)".
  " (delta=$delta_two)\n";

my $avg = ($delta_one + $delta_two) / 2;
print "\n\n==> iter takes $delta_one/$delta_two cycles (average = $avg)\n";
\end{verbatim}




\subsubsection{Sample calculations}
