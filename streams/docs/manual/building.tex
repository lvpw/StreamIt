\section{Building the StreamIt Compiler and Libraries}

\subsection{Building the Compiler}
Building the StreamIt compiler is as easy as
going to the {\tt streams/compiler} directory and typing
{\tt make}. This should create the necessary lexers and
parsers and fully compile the compiler.
The compiler (mostly) resides in {\tt streams/compiler},
but there are some dependencies on files from the Java 
library in {\tt streams/library\slash{}java} as well as 
dependencies on the {\tt cplex} and {\tt antlr} packages.
You shouldn't have to worry about these additional complications
as the Makefile and {\tt dot-shell} should take care of things.

\subsection{Building the Java Library}
The Java library lives in {\tt streams/library/java}. It is 
used to run StreamIt programs that are compiled into Java 
bytecodes. Since the compiler relies on some of the classes
in the Java Library, building the compiler should have build
the library as well. To make sure, or to rebuild the library,
you can go to the {\tt streams\slash{}library/java/streamit} 
directory and run {\tt jikes *.java}.

\subsection{Building the C Library}
The C library is used to compile the output of the StreamIt
compiler's uniprocessor backend. To build the library, 
go to the {\tt streams/library/c} and run {\tt make}. 
This will create the file {\tt libstreamit.a}, 
which contains all of the library functions necessary to create
an executable from the compiler's output.
