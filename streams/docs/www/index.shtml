	  <b>StreamIt</b> is a programming language and a compilation
	  infrastructure, specifically engineered for modern streaming
	  systems. It is designed to facilitate the programming of
	  large streaming applications, as well as their efficient and
	  effective mapping to a wide variety of target architectures,
	  including commercial-off-the-shelf uniprocessors,
	  multi-clustered architectures, and the emerging class of
	  grid-processors.
