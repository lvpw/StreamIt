	  Streaming systems are  characterized by concurrent computation
        kernels  that   process  potentially  infinite   sequences  of
        data. Such systems are  increasingly important in a wide range
        of computing  domains, ranging from embedded  systems and DSPs
        to large scale and high performance systems such as multimedia
        editing   consoles,  internet   routers,  and   cellular  base
        stations.<br> 
	  <br>
	  <b>StreamIt</b> is a programming language and a compilation
        infrastructure, specifically engineered for modern streaming
        systems.  It is designed to facilitate the programming of large
        streaming applications, as well as their efficient mapping to
        a wide variety of target architectures, including
        commercial-off-the-shelf uniprocessors, multi-clustered
        architectures, and the emerging class of grid-processors
	  [<a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/commit-papers.pl?keyword=4">StreamIt Publications</a>].<br>
        <br> 
	  The StreamIt programming and compilation paradigm makes
        the following contributions:
	  <ul>
	    <li><p align="justify"> Language constructs that improve
    programmer productivity for streaming, including hierarchical
    structured streams, graph parameterization, and circular buffer
    management; these constructs also enable novel compiler analyses [<a
    href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/streamit/papers/streamit-cc.pdf">CC'02</a>].
	    </p>
	    <li><p align="justify">
    An optimizing compiler infrastructure for the <a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/raw">MIT Raw machine</a>,
    with fully automatic load balancing, graph layout, communication
    scheduling, and routing [<a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/streamit/papers/streamit-asplos.pdf">ASPLOS'02</a>, <a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/streamit/results/index.html">details</a>].
	    </p>
          <li><p align="justify">
    A robust compilation infrastructure that compiles to an ANSI C
    runtime library for execution on a general-purpose uniprocessor.
    </p>
    <li><p align="justify">
    A set of domain-specific optimizations for linear filters, in which
    each output is a weighted sum of the inputs (e.g., FIR, FFT, DCT).
    The analysis automatically detects linear filters and performs
    large-scale algebraic simplification of adjacent components, as well
    as automated translation into the frequency domain [<a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03</a>, 
    <a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/linear">details</a>].
	    </p>
	    <li><p align="justify"> 
    A minimal latency scheduler that leverages phased scheduling to
    produce a deadlock-free schedule for hierarchical stream graphs.
    Phased scheduling also offers a flexible tradeoff between code size
    and buffer size [<a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/lctes-phased.pdf">LCTES'03</a>].
<!--
</p><li><p align="justify">
    A dynamic programming partitioner that is used for load balancing
    (in the Raw backend) and optimization selection (for linear
    optimizations).  The partitioner efficiently searches a large space
    of hierarchical stream configurations to optimize a given metric.
-->
</p><li align="justify">
   A high-level stream IR (in Java) with a host of graph
transformations, including graph canonicalization, synchronization
removal, refactoring of parallel components, fusion of adjacent
filters (running in parallel or in sequence), and fission of
individual filters (into data-parallel or task-parallel components.)
	    </p>
	    <li><p align="justify"> A set of 
	      <a href="../html/benchmarks.html">benchmarks</a> for the
	      evaluation of streaming optimizations and architectures.
	    </p>
	  </ul>

	  <b>StreamIt</b>  is  the  <a  href="../html/people.html">result  of
        several  years  of  research  and  development</a>  under  the
        fearless        leadership        of       Professor        <a
        href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/~saman">Saman  Amarasinghe</a> at
        the   <a   href="http://csail.mit.edu">Computer  Science   and
        Artificial      Intelligence     Laboratory</a>      at     <a
        href="http://www.mit.edu">MIT</a>.

	<p>The StreamIt project is supported by DARPA, NSF, and the
MIT Oxygen Alliance.
