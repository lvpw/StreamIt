\section{Multicore Scheduling Framework}

concept of code objects, data (buffer) objects, and communication
channels

virtual layer allows for portability: static and dynamic compilers
(static and dynamic schedulers) operate at the virtual layer, focusing
on application level details wrt code and data partitioning, and
communication

implementation below the layer is optimized separately, hides tedious
details of the architecture (e.g., alignment, local store vs cache)

\section{Stream Computing in the Multicore Scheduling Framework}

streaming application provide an easy starting point to map 

streaming program represented as a connected graph to expose
computation and communication

StreamIt used as the language to describe streaming codes

StreamIt compiler already includes a rich set of optimizations and
transformation
