\section{Tolerating Variance With Static Schedules}

A particular challenge that a static scheduler faces is posed by the
work estimation $W_X$ for an actor $X$. The static scheduling requires
an effective work estimation methodology. Previous work in feedback
directed optimizations has shown that profiling is a practical
approach to characterizing applications. There are numerous examples
of profiling used for various compiler optimizations such as inlining,
unrolling, data prefetching, trace formation, etc. And prior related
work on scheduling of stream graphs has shown that good static
estimation of work is
feasible~\cite{mgordon-asplos04,mgordon-asplos06}.
