\section{Tolerating Variance With Static Schedules}

While the scheduling patterns described in the previous section can
achieve the best possible utilization and throughput (when scheduled
for two processors), there are factors used to derive the schedules
that may vary at runtime. A particular challenge that a static
scheduler must deal with is the notion of work units $W_X$required by
an actor $X$. The static scheduling requires good static estimation on
the work requirements of an actor. Previous work in feedback directed
optimizations has shown that profiling is a practical approach to
characterizing applications. There are numerous examples of profiling
used for various compiler optimizations such as inlining, unrolling,
data prefetching, trace formation, etc.
