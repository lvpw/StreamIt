\section{Fundamental Scheduling Patterns}

In this paper, we require that the push, pop, and peek rates of each
filter are known at compile time.  This enables the compiler to
calculate a steady-state for the stream graph: a repetition of each
filter that does not change the number of items buffered on any data
channel~\cite{lee87,karczmarek:lctes:2003}. In combination with a
simple program analysis that estimates the number of operations
performed on each invocation of a given work function, the
steady-state repetitions offer an estimate of the work performed by a
given filter as a fraction of the overall program execution.  This
estimate is important for our software pipelining technique.
