\subsection{Stream Graph Partitioning}
\label{sec:partition}

StreamIt provides the filter construct as the basic abstract unit of
autonomous stream computation.  The programmer should decide the
boundaries of each filter according to what is most natural for the
algorithm under consideration.  While one could envision each filter
running on a separate machine in a parallel system, StreamIt hides the
granularity of the target machine from the programmer.  Thus, it is
the responsibility of the compiler to adapt the granularity of the
stream graph for efficient execution on a particular architecture.

We use the word {\it partitioning} to refer to the process of dividing
a stream program into a set of balanced computation units.  Given that
a maximum of $N$ computation units can be supported, the partitioning
stage transforms a stream graph into a set of no more than $N$
filters, each of which performs approximately the same amount of work
during the execution of the program.  Following this stage, each
filter can be run on a separate processor to obtain a load-balanced
executable.

    53 unbalanced tiles (original) to 15 balanced tiles (partitioned).

Our partitioner employs a set of fusion, fission, and reordering
transformations to incrementally adjust the stream graph to the
desired granularity.  To achieve load balancing, the compiler
estimates the number of instructions that are executed by each filter
in one steady-state cycle of the entire program; then, computationally
intensive filters can be split, and less demanding filters can be
fused.  Currently, a simple greedy algorithm is used to automatically
select the targets of fusion and fission, based on the estimate of the
work in each node.


For example, in the case of the Radar application, the original
stream graph (Figure~\ref{fig:beam-orig}) contains 52 filters.  These
filters have unbalanced amounts of computation, as evidenced by the
execution trace in Figure~\ref{fig:beam-blood1}.  The partitioner
fuses all of the pipelines in the graph, and then fuses the bottom
4-way splitjoin into a 2-way splitjoin, yielding the stream graph in
Figure~\ref{fig:beam-opt}.  As illustrated by the execution trace in
Figure~\ref{fig:beam-blood2}, the partitioned graph has much better
load balancing.  In the following sections, we describe in more detail
the transformations utilized by the partitioner.


\subsubsection{Fusion Transformations}

Filter fusion is a transformation whereby several adjacent filters are
combined into one.  Fusion can be applied to decrease the granularity
of a stream graph so that an application will fit on a given target,
or to improve load balancing by merging small filters so that there is
space for larger filters to be split.  Analogous to loop fusion in the
scientific domain, filter fusion can enable other optimizations by
merging the control flow graphs of adjacent nodes, thereby shortening
the live ranges of variables and allowing independent instructions to
be reordered.



\subsubsection{Fission Transformations}

Filter fission is the analog of parallelization in the streaming
domain.  It can be applied to increase the granularity of a stream
graph to utilize unused processor resources, or to break up a
computationally intensive node for improved load balancing.


\subsubsection{Reordering Transformations}

There are a multitude of ways to reorder the elements of a stream
graph so as to facilitate fission and fusion transformations.  For
instance, neighboring splitters and joiners with matching weights can
be eliminated a splitjoin construct can be divided into a hierarchical
set of splitjoins to enable a finer granularity of fusion and
identical stateless filters can be pushed through a splitter or joiner
node if the weights are adjusted accordingly.

\subsubsection{Automatic Partitioning}

In order to drive the partitioning process, we have implemented a
simple greedy algorithm that performs well on most applications.  The
algorithm analyzes the {\tt work} function of each filter and
estimates the number of cycles required to execute it.  
In the case where there are fewer filters than tiles, the partitioner
considers the filters in decreasing order of their computational
requirements and attempts to split them using the filter fission
algorithm described above.  
If the stream graph contains more nodes than the target architecture,
then the partitioner works in the opposite direction and repeatedly
fuses the least demanding stream construct until the graph will fit on
the target.  

Despite its simplicity, this greedy strategy works well in practice
because most applications have many more filters than can fit on the
target architecture; since there is a long sequence of fusion
operations, it is easy to compensate from a short-sighted greedy
decision.  However, we can construct cases in which a greedy strategy
will fail.  For instance, graphs with wildly unbalanced filters will
require fission of some components and fusion of others; also, some
graphs have complex symmetries where fusion or fission will not be
beneficial unless applied uniformly to each component of the graph.
We are working on improved partitioning algorithms that take these
measures into account.
