As multicore architectures gain increasingly widespread use, it becomes increasingly important to be able to harness the
additional processing power to achieve higher performance. However, exploiting the parallel cores is difficult from a
programmer's perspective because most existing programs languages dictate a sequential method of execution.

Stream programming, which organizes programs by independent filters communicating over explicit data channels, 
exposes useful types of parallelism that can be exploited. However, there is still the burden of mapping high-level stream programs to
specific multicore architectures. The complexities of each architecture's underlying details makes it difficult to
schedule the execution of a stream program with high performance.

In this paper, we present the specifications for an intermediate layer between the stream program and the target architecture.
This multicore streaming layer (MSL) provides a common level of abstraction that facilitates the efficient scheduling and
execution of stream programs. We implemented the framework for one such layer for the Cell processor and StreamIt language
and achieved greater than
90\% utilization on all benchmarks with relatively small amounts of code. The framework can also be applied to other
architectures and stream programming languages to enhance generality and portability.



%%The Cell architecture is a heterogeneous, distributed-memory multicore architecture that features a novel on-chip communication network. Stream programs are particularly well-suited for execution on Cell.

%%This thesis implements a runtime library on Cell specifically designed to support streaming applications and streaming language compilers. The runtime library abstracts the details of Cell's communication network and provides facilities that simplify the task of scheduling stream actors. The library is designed in the context of the StreamIt programming language.

%%This library is used to implement a dynamic scheduling framework. The programmability of high-level schedulers with and without the library is analyzed. We observe that the library does not add significant overhead, provides a number of useful features for schedulers, and greatly simplifies the code required to implement schedulers.
