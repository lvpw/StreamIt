\section{Conclusions}\label{ch:conc}

Streaming languages such as StreamIt provide an excellent way to target new multicore architectures while placing minimal parallelization burden on the programmer. The Cell architecture is designed to offer high peak performance, and is very suited for streaming applications. This thesis described a runtime framework for streaming applications on Cell consisting of \emph{i}) a runtime library that provides high-level primitives for schedulers and \emph{ii}) a dynamic scheduler for stream graphs. The framework greatly simplifies the task of a streaming language compiler or scheduler.

The real benefit provided by the framework, in particular the runtime library, is that it allows a scheduler to think directly in terms of filters and how they are scheduled instead of lower-level architecture-specific details. It requires far less code to implement scheduling patterns on top of the library than directly on Cell hardware, and the library also allows far more complex patterns to be implemented. The runtime library running the data-parallel fused FFT benchmark produces a reasonably small amount of overhead (1.2\%), and the dynamic scheduler running the pipelined version of the benchmark produces an acceptable amount of overhead (8.6\%).

\section{Future Work}

The runtime library currently provides two orthogonal branches that can be further developed. First, it is important to reduce the 9\% overhead observed in the pipelined FFT tests involving the dynamic scheduler. This overhead is entirely due to the cost of the run list when many commands are active, and it can probably be significantly reduced by optimizing library code, although it is also likely that doing so would make the SPE library implementation, especially the run list, much more specialized.

In addition, the library currently lacks real support for filters with dynamic rates -- the library simply leaves the responsibility of tracking rates to the scheduler entirely. Feedback from the library on how much data filters have produced and consumed would be very useful for schedulers; ultimately, the library should have some way of running filters with unbounded dynamic rates. The latter would require a general mechanism to suspend dynamic rate filters in the middle of executing their work functions.

The dynamic scheduler can be extended in many directions. The simplest additions involve adjusting the metric used for selecting filters to test and improve the performance of the dynamic scheduler as work becomes more and more imbalanced between filters. In addition, an important advantage of dynamic scheduling in general is the ability to react to dynamic rate filters and the runtime distribution of work in the stream graph; implementing robust support for dynamic rate filters in the stream graph would drastically increase its usefulness.
