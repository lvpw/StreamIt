This section walks through a sample session with the compiler and
runtime system.  We will use the {\tt FMRadio} benchmark from the
StreamIt release as a running example.  To get started, change to the
following directory:
\begin{verbatim}
cd $STREAMIT_HOME/apps/benchmarks/fm/streamit
\end{verbatim}
The benchmark is in {\tt FMRadio.str}.  Note that it differs slightly
from the version developed in this cookbook.
