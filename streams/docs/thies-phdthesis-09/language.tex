\chapter{The StreamIt Language}



Intro
-----

Multicore + review of previous parallel languages
MATLAB

Language
--------
Each with a ``rationale'' section

0. model of computation
  - synchronous dataflow
  - we are first language to adopt SDF model?
1. structured streams
  - pictures of stream graphs
  - idioms found
  - example syntax
  * rationale
    - see structure from code
    - dynamic programming solution
2. language-level support for reordering
  - not complete
  - transpose
  - bit-reversal
  * rationale
    - compression
3. language-level support for sliding window operations
  - e.g., parallelism hidden in low-pass filter
  * rationale
    - easier to parallelize
4. control messages
  * rationale
    - improves programmability
    - could possibly optimize execution?  (TODO)
5. related work
  - the standard language-related work

First language with structured streams, language-level support for
data reordering, sliding-window, and control messages.

StreamIt Experience
-------------------

this section mainly describes optimizing an SDF language. generally
applies for languages outside streamit as well.

- application suite
  - big ones
    - GMTI
    - MPEG
    - mosaic
  - application characteristics
    - roundrobin weights
    - peeking
    - stateful/stateless
  - graphics rendering
- optimizations
  - linear
  - statespace
  - cache
  - parallelization
  - phased scheduling
- lessons learned (or move to language section?)
  - phases bad
  - programmers can introduce mutable state
  - I/O rates often matched
  - fine-grained communication on Raw not worth it
  - greedy is good?  dynamic programming solution
- leaving out?
  - third-party uses?
    - bit-streaming / sketching
    - mani / VIRAM
  - debugging / gui's

Future Work
-----------
- zeroing out arrays is expensive, should optimize away (move to lessons learned?)
- buffer reuse
- interesting messaging optimization:
  - speculatively fuse or linearly-collapse sections that have messages
  - if message observed, rollback and deliver on slow path afterwards
- decimation propagation

Conclusions
-----------
- show evolution of c++ graph?


Where to fit in?
----------------
- different fusion strategies?  (contradicts other research)
