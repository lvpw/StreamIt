---------------

* put a whole benchmark in an appendix

"this chapter is a large project, many people have worked on it"
"primary description of this work is somewhere else, go look at it"
remove "project leader part"
say that it is described in other people's theses
summary will show that language is amenable to optimization

--------------------------

Big things:
* more honest communication of uniprocessor performance relative to C
  - and more clear about baselines in abstract, conclusions, etc.
* SDEP calculation does not work for actors that need to fire a full
  steady state during the initialization schedule
  - replace right and wrong one with a single correct one
* SDEP not surjective, what do you do? 
  - SOLUTION:
   - current downstream constraints are:
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)) >= n + k_1
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)) <= n + k_2
   - want to change them: 
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)) >= n + k_1
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)-1) < n + k_2
* possibly revise writeup of constrained scheduling
* check that messaging speedup makes any sense?
* address arvind/srini comments in conclusion:  does this extend to dynamism?
* acknowledgments
* Saman comments (including pending comments)
* make compression complete

Little things:
* say that adding an iter() keyword would remove additional state
  - where?
  - AssignPictureType in MPEGencoder.str
* reconcile 3GPP in language section with the benchmark section
* fix first sentence of abstract to not define the domain of stream
  programs
* add sliding window to stream program characteristics
* somewhere say that two-stage filters also important for eliminating state
  - e.g., delay, integerdifferenceencoder/decoder (jpeg.str)
  - look at prework
* acknowledge Amy as authoring raytracer
* explain that in stream graphs, nodes annotated with "work=unknown"
  represent cases where our work estimation algorithm was known to do
  poorly, so we did not include it in the report
- mention StreaMIT pronunciation?
- note from rodric (same with FFT1Dshift)
  // 2D FFT shift: criss-cross swap of the four matrix quadrants
  // NOTE: if there were a reverse roundrobin joiner, it would be
  // trivial to do this data reorganization
  complex->complex filter FFT2Dshift(int rows, int cols)
- mention diffs of apps between apps table and other sections

Mindless:
- cite seneff vocoder article (from asplos'02) so it appears in appendix
- cite Tennenhouse, D., Bose, V.: The SpectrumWare Approach to Wireless Signal Processing. Wireless Networks (1999))
  for OFDM
- indicate messaging pairs on mpeg encode, mpeg decode, mosaic stream graph
  - and check MPEG2 encoder portals (done haphazardly while tired)
- fix bibliography
- fix vspace between figures, and between figures and text (Saman)
- make pullSchedule font same as repeat_lengths font, etc.
- consider finding good bold-italic font for my numbered titles
- improve formatting of code (bold the keywords)
- get grant numbers for acknowledgements
  - ask mary to get grants I'm funded from while here
- check latest download numbers

Probably not fixing:
. mildly bothersome: the cache section is somewhat inconsistent about
  referring to static state of a filter as only instructions
  vs. instructions+data
. big thing missing: some review of the basic compiler?  stages, flow, etc.
. add section on embedding streamit in a general purpose language? mention java lib 
. it looks like the filterbank linear flops removed doesn't match pldi (but does
  match aalamb thesis).  check numbers are sound.
. copyright infringement on numerical recipes?
. redo graphs of sorts, a few dcts (missing hierarchy)?
