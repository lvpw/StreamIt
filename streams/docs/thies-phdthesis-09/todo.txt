Note to Saman:
- missing abstract, conclusions, chap 5, benchmark details

Before committee:
* note that SDEP assumes no initialization schedule (thu no prework, no peeking)
* possibly revise writeup of constrained scheduling
* check that messaging speedup makes any sense?
- benchmarks table
- redo abstract
- search for linear in compression and adjust depending on inclusion of opt. chap
- add stream graphs for all benchmarks?

After defense:
- look for bogus vspace and remove it (e.g., next to figures)
- make pullSchedule font same as repeat_lengths font, etc.
- mention StreaMIT pronunciation?
- fix duplicated citations
- consider finding good bold-italic font for my numbered titles
- copyright infringement on numerical recipes?
- improve formatting of code (bold the keywords)
- get grant numbers for acknowledgements
- check latest download numbers
- get permission from peter mattson
