- fix first sentence of abstract to not define the domain of stream
  programs
- add sliding window to stream program characteristics

After defense:
* do benchmark characteristics (and add stream graphs for all benchmarks?)
* more honest communication of uniprocessor performance relative to C
  - and more clear about baselines in abstract, conclusions, etc.
* SDEP calculation does not work for actors that need to fire a full
  steady state during the initialization schedule
  - replace right and wrong one with a single correct one
* possibly revise writeup of constrained scheduling
* check that messaging speedup makes any sense?
+ big thing missing: some review of the basic compiler?  stages, flow, etc.
+ add section on embedding streamit in a general purpose language? mention java lib 
+ it looks like the filterbank linear flops removed doesn't match pldi (but does
  match aalamb thesis).  check numbers are sound.
- look for bogus vspace and remove it (e.g., next to figures)
- make pullSchedule font same as repeat_lengths font, etc.
- mention StreaMIT pronunciation?
- consider finding good bold-italic font for my numbered titles
- copyright infringement on numerical recipes?
- improve formatting of code (bold the keywords)
- get grant numbers for acknowledgements
  - ask mary to get grants I'm funded from while here
- check latest download numbers
- mildly bothersome: the cache section is somewhat inconsistent about
  referring to static state of a filter as only instructions
  vs. instructions+data
- SDEP not surjective, what do you do? 
  - SOLUTION:
   - current downstream constraints are:
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)) >= n + k_1
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)) <= n + k_2
   - want to change them: 
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)) >= n + k_1
     SDEP_A<-B (M(A,B,k1,k2,n)-1) < n + k_2
