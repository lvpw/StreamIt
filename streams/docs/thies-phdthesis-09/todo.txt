----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mindless:
. fix aligment of appendix chapters in TOC, list of figures
. indicate messaging pairs on mpeg encode, mpeg decode, mosaic stream graph
. adjust lists in intro (stream benchmarks, SDF analyses, etc.)
. more CD-DAT references
n make cd-dat and jpeg look exactly the same in language section
n make pullSchedule font same as repeat_lengths font, etc.
n improve formatting of code (bold the keywords)

Probably not fixing:
n possibly fix cache section (static vs. dynamic)
n in language section, propagate benchmark numbers to summary
n mention StreaMIT pronunciation?
n Mosaic might have a [1,*,1] rate lingering
n continue app evaluation
  - more detailed characterization of splitjoins?  + identity filters.
  - explain filter / graph reuse across the suite (will require refactoring)
  - were built-in splitter joiner types sufficient?  what would have benefitted more?
n compare streamit GMTI to dynamically-extracted GMTI (or MP3, MPEG-2)
n check if messaging speedup makes any sense?
n mildly bothersome: the cache section is somewhat inconsistent about
  referring to static state of a filter as only instructions
  vs. instructions+data
n big thing missing: some review of the basic compiler?  stages, flow, etc.
n add section on embedding streamit in a general purpose language? mention java lib 
n it looks like the filterbank linear flops removed doesn't match pldi (but does
  match aalamb thesis).  check numbers are sound.
n copyright infringement on numerical recipes?
n redo graphs of sorts, a few dcts (missing hierarchy)?
