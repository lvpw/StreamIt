Big things:
* first sentence of abstract
* address arvind/srini comments in conclusion:  does this extend to dynamism?
  - see feedback.txt
* 88% utilization on cell -- one simd lane

* acknowledgments
  - including grant numbers
  - check acks (including first page of opt section) w/ karcmza, gordo, rodric
* related work
  - general diff to brook 
  - peeking has been done before
    - sliding windows were in Signal (1986)
    - looks like SA-C has sliding windows (1999) yup.
      http://www.cs.colostate.edu/cameron/SACoverview.html#Anchor-Th-17671
    - blocking them (paper sent to mike)
  - diff to sh (they coarsen granularity)
* fix bibliography
  - cite seneff vocoder article (from asplos'02) so it appears in appendix
  - cite Tennenhouse, D., Bose, V.: The SpectrumWare Approach to Wireless Signal Processing. Wireless Networks (1999)) for OFDM
* check layout
* proofread

Little things:
- mention diffs of apps between apps table and other sections?
- in language section, propagate benchmark numbers to summary
- check correctness of compression section

Mindless:
- improve link coloration to be more subtle (just colored font, no outlines)
- adjust lists in intro (stream benchmarks, SDF analyses, etc.)
- more CD-DAT references
- indicate messaging pairs on mpeg encode, mpeg decode, mosaic stream graph
- make cd-dat and jpeg look exactly the same in language section
- make pullSchedule font same as repeat_lengths font, etc.
- improve formatting of code (bold the keywords)

Probably not fixing:
. mention StreaMIT pronunciation?
. Mosaic might have a [1,*,1] rate lingering
. explain that in stream graphs, nodes annotated with "work=unknown"
  represent cases where our work estimation algorithm was known to do
  poorly, so we did not include it in the report
. continue app evaluatoin
  - more detailed characterization of splitjoins?  + identity filters.
  - explain filter / graph reuse across the suite (will require refactoring)
  - were built-in splitter joiner types sufficient?  what would have benefitted more?
. compare streamit GMTI to dynamically-extracted GMTI (or MP3, MPEG-2)
. check if messaging speedup makes any sense?
. mildly bothersome: the cache section is somewhat inconsistent about
  referring to static state of a filter as only instructions
  vs. instructions+data
. big thing missing: some review of the basic compiler?  stages, flow, etc.
. add section on embedding streamit in a general purpose language? mention java lib 
. it looks like the filterbank linear flops removed doesn't match pldi (but does
  match aalamb thesis).  check numbers are sound.
. copyright infringement on numerical recipes?
. redo graphs of sorts, a few dcts (missing hierarchy)?
