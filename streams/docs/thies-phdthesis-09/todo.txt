Borderline:
* do benchmark characteristics (and add stream graphs for all benchmarks?)

After defense:
* more honest communication of uniprocessor performance relative to C
  - and more clear about baselines in abstract, conclusions, etc.
* note that SDEP assumes no initialization schedule (thu no prework, no peeking)
* possibly revise writeup of constrained scheduling
* check that messaging speedup makes any sense?
* fix job talk slides:  radar added way more than 2.4x more flops with maximal
  - actually 33x
+ big thing missing: some review of the basic compiler?  stages, flow, etc.
+ add section on embedding streamit in a general purpose language? mention java lib 
+ it looks like the filterbank linear flops removed doesn't match pldi (but does
  match aalamb thesis).  check numbers are sound.
- look for bogus vspace and remove it (e.g., next to figures)
- make pullSchedule font same as repeat_lengths font, etc.
- mention StreaMIT pronunciation?
- fix duplicated citations
- consider finding good bold-italic font for my numbered titles
- copyright infringement on numerical recipes?
- improve formatting of code (bold the keywords)
- get grant numbers for acknowledgements
- check latest download numbers
- mildly bothersome: the cache section is somewhat inconsistent about
  referring to static state of a filter as only instructions
  vs. instructions+data
