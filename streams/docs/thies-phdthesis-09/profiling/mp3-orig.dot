# CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL:
# In original, the first "antialias" node as merged with the upstream "top of loop".  I separated
# this node so that it didn't look confusing to have one antialias node feeding another.

# also commenting out three lines that will have to be added manually, for the sake of precision
