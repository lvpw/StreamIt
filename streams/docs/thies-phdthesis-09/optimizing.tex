%% this section mainly describes optimizing an SDF language. generally
%% applies for languages outside streamit as well.

%% - optimizations
%%   - parallelization
%%   - linear + statespace
%%   - cache
%%   n phased scheduling
%% - mention standard transformations:
%%   - fission / fusion
%%   - sync removal

%% ----------------------

%% - lessons learned
%%   - fine-grained communication on Raw not worth it
%%   - greedy is good?  dynamic programming solution
%%   - what was useful in language for compiler's sake?
%%    - peeking was useful for compiler
%%    - data reordering was useful for compiler
%%    - structure was less useful for compiler
%%      - mostly just dynamic programming solution
%%      - phased scheduling was easier to formulate
%%      - COULD have been useful for parameterized IR

%% - leaving out?
%%   - third-party uses?
%%     - bit-streaming / sketching
%%     - mani / VIRAM
%%   - debugging / gui's
