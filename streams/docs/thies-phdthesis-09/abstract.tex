%% We characterize high-performance streaming applications as a new and
%% distinct domain of programs that is becoming increasingly prevalent.
%% The StreamIt language provides novel high-level representations to
%% improve programmer productivity and program robustness within the
%% streaming domain.  At the same time, the StreamIt compiler aims to
%% improve the performance of streaming applications via stream-specific
%% analyses and optimizations.

%% In the context of StreamIt, this thesis will demonstrate the benefits
%% of providing language and compiler support specifically for stream
%% programming.  We will discuss the design rationale for StreamIt,
%% including our experience in leveraging StreamIt's properties for novel
%% optimizations.  We will also present two novel analyses for stream
%% programs: one that translates programs to operate directly on
%% compressed data streams, and one that extracts a streaming
%% representation from an ordinary C program.
