%% Multicore architectures offer a significant amount of coarse-grained
%% parallelism on chip. They also increase the burden on programmers who
%% now have to explicitly extract coarse-grained parallelism from their
%% codes in order to leverage the compute potential available in emerging
%% processors. Multimedia applications are especially challenging because
%% they require stream abstractions that are not easily representd using
%% current programming paradigms, and general purpose compilers eschew
%% stream-aware optimizations. As a result, applications are hand-coded
%% for performance, and this practice precludes portability, and
%% obfuscates readability. 
The goal of the StreamIt project is to become the language of choice
for streaming applications, which include multimedia codes, as well as
cryptography, networking and security, and some forms of scientific
computation. StreamIt provides a high level stream language and a
stream-aware compiler that leverages domain specific language
constructs to deliver high performance from high levels of
abstraction. We believe that StreamIt will lead to a dramatic
improvement in programmer productivity, program robustness,
portability, and performance scalability on commodity multicore
architectures. A key component of the research is to also provide
seamless integration with other programming practices,  because large
applications have various properties that may require different
language abstractions. This paper outlines a methodology that allows
StreamIt programs to run as part of the X10 virtual machine. X10 is
one of three general purpose languages under development from vendors
designing large scale parallel platforms.
