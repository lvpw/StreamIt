Multicore architectures offer a significant amount of coarse-grained
parallelism on chip. They also increase the burden on programmers who
now have to explicitly extract coarse-grained parallelism from their
codes in order to leverage the compute potential available in emerging
processors. Multimedia applications are especially challenging because
they require stream abstractions that are not easily represented using
current programming paradigms, and general purpose compilers eschew
stream-aware optimizations. As a result, applications are hand-coded
for performance, and this practice precludes portability, and
obfuscates readability. 

%% Application developers face new challenges as they port and redesign
%% their codes to run on multicore architectures. Multicore processors
%% from IBM, Intel, AMD, Sun, and other vendors, have  marked a
%% significant departure from the von Neumann architecture paradigm that
%% catalyzed the growth of the computing industry for the last few
%% decades.  The change in processor design is largely due to scalability
%% challenges imposed by wire delay and power consumption. The emerging
%% architectures place less emphasis on raw clock speed as means for
%% better performance, focusing instead on massive capabilities for
%% concurrent execution. The IBM Cell processor for example is touted as
%% a supercomputer on a chip. It will appear in a new line of IBM blade
%% servers that power various tiers of the computing industry. 

%% The computation abilities of multicore architectures require explicit
%% code parallelization to tap their full potential. This will inevitably
%% translate to arduous manual tuning and recoding of applications, since
%% automatic parallelization technology by a compiler has long failed to
%% deliver acceptable results for applications expressed in general
%% purpose languages. Partly, the reasons for the shortcomings are due to the
%% heroic analysis efforts required to determine legal code orchestration
%% for parallel execution.

%% Leading vendors have recognized the need for new programming
%% abstractions that will lessen the burden on programmers and
%% compilers. New languages such as X10~\cite{x10} from IBM place a great
%% emphasis on exposing data distributions across virtual computation
%% locales, and provide new abstractions geared toward making programmers
%% more productive while concomitantly making parallel computing
%% constructs first class citizens in the languages they design.
%% However, time and again parallel languages have failed to gain
%% momentum because they have demanded more from the programmers. A new
%% programming paradigm cannot increase the burden on the programmer, who
%% is already teetering on the abyss of complexity.

The StreamIt project at MIT provides a language~\cite{streamitcc} with
simple abstractions for parallel programming, and a stream-aware
compiler~\cite{agrawal05cases,gordon02asplos,lamb03pldi,sermulins05lctes}
that delivers scalable high performance on a variety of commodity
processors~\cite{gordon02asplos, raw04isca}. StreamIt is focused on
stream programming ubiquitous to multimedia and digital signal
processing, as well as applications drawn from cryptography, security,
networking, and some forms of scientific computing. In StreamIt,
computation is carried out by autonomous filters, and data are
communicated over well structured topologies that interconnect the
filters. The StreamIt programming model allows the programmer to build
an application by connecting components together into a stream
graph. The programmer is relieved of the burden of explicit buffer
management and complex index expressions for multi-dimensional data,
and naturally exposes the parallelism and communication patterns
inherent to their codes.  The end result is clean, malleable, and
portable code~\cite{drake06ipdps}.

The StreamIt project is also concerned with providing seamless
integration between streaming codes and other programming
practices. This is necessary because large scale applications have
various properties, each requiring a different language approach. The
alternative is to use a single general purpose language for an
application, although this practice hides program details that are
necessary for good compilation strategies. StreamIt provides an
interface to native code, such that the streaming computation is
expressed in StreamIt, and the remaining code is implemented in
languages such as C, C++, or Java. The interface allows native code to
invoke the StreamIt pipeline, and vice versa.  In addition, we are
exploring the use of emerging languages such as X10~\cite{x10} as
frameworks for providing first class support for domain specific
language primitives. We have designed and built a prototype
environment that allows StreamIt programs to run as part of the X10
virtual machine. The bridge implements the StreamIt language
abstractions using new constructs founded upon the X10 language
primitives. We are currently evaluating the productivity merits of
this approach, along with the performance potential it affords.

The StreamIt development environment, optimizing compiler, and set of
streaming benchmarks are available for download from the project
