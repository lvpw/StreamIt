\section{Conclusions}

%% Many of the applications that will drive the next generation of
%% computing systems---digital video editing, computer vision, computer
%% graphics and animation---operate on image and video formats that are
%% universally stored in compressed data formats.  

In order to accelerate operations on compressible data, this paper
presents a general technique for translating programs into the
compressed domain.  Given a natural program that operates on
uncompressed data, our transformation outputs a program that directly
operates on the compressed data format.  We support lossless
compression formats based on LZ77.  In the general case, the
transformed program may need to partially decompress the data to
perform the computation, though this decompression is minimized
throughout the process and significant compression ratios are
preserved without resorting to an explicit re-compression step.

Though our transformations would likely prove intractable in a
language such as C, they are quite straightforward in the synchronous
dataflow model.  Synchronous dataflow is supported by high-level
languages such as StreamIt and is a natural fit for media processing
applications.  Because each actor in a synchronous dataflow graph has
a regular pattern of communication, it can easily be wrapped in our
compressed execution driver.  A similar transformation may be possible
in a functional language, if the compiler can detect that a function
is repeatedly applied across a window of data.

Our techniques demonstrate excellent speedups in our experimental
evaluation.  Across a suite of 12 videos in Apple Animation format,
computing directly on compressed data offers a speedup roughly
proportional to the compression ratio.  For pixel transformations
(brightness, contrast, inverse) speedups range from 3.1x to 235x, with
a median of 19x; for video compositing operations (overlays and
mattes) speedups range from 1.0x to 35x, with a median of 7.4x.  While
previous researchers have used special-purpose compressed processing
techniques to obtain speedups on lossy, DCT-based codecs, we are
unaware of a comparable demonstration for lossless video compression.
As digital films and animated features have embraced lossless formats
for the editing process, the speedups obtained may have significant
practical value.
