Swartz and Smith, (RIVL) - Resolution Independent Video Language~\cite{languages/swartz95}
 - builds sequence of image transformations and does lazy evaluation to avoid computing pixels that are not seen

Levine describes new representations for audio signals that allow modifying playback speed or pitch without decompression\cite{audio/Levine}

Shoji presents a technique for performing transpose and other affine
operations on run-length encoded images~\cite{shoji95}; Misra at
al. later improved the memory efficiency of the
technique~\cite{images/99-misra}.  Levine describes new
representations for audio signals that allow modifying playback speed
or pitch without decompressing the data\cite{audio/Levine}
