Before submission:
------------------

- EXAMPLES of transformations
  - add source-to-source StreamIt transformation

- abstract: 
  - also reducing volume of data operated on
  - Apple Animation not "based on" LZ77
  - check numbers

- results:
  - backwards pointer to apple animation
  - possibly describe 1x,1x case on scatter plot
  - add pictures of video frames?

- future work
  - lossy formats: linear transformations
    - preliminary experiments report over a 10x gain
    - can also support linear prediction this way

After submission:
-----------------

- if you combined intra-align and inter-align, could you get better
  compression?  Maybe intra-align expands LCM's too far

- look at more mencoder transformations
    - autolevels, IIR filters, FIR filters, etc.

- get breakdown of time spent processing vs. time spent re-compressing
  - can't really explain why encode_frame is so high (e.g., noop/inverse/screencast1)
  - delete *.so* in ffmpeg directory and rebuild blender to link
