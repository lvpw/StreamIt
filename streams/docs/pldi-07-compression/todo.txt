* add StreamIt code for benchmarks

* possibly omit mention of coarsen-repeat for splitters/joiners

* caption the splitter/joiner notation with "pos"

- comment on optimality of LZ77 (within constant factor of optimal, as
  opposed to LZW which is not)

- change \mbox{floor} to floor symbols?

From reviewers:
---------------

* make more clear what properties are required of (i) compression
  scheme and (ii) of the transformations.  e.g., halfwidth ok,
  halfheight not.

* Push "ana banana" example into section 3, adding text transformation

+ Perhaps make more clear that pixel test programs don't incur
  alignment penalties because they consume one byte at a time.

- Use of "averting" in the intro is awkward.

- "it did take me some time to realise the key idea that the
  'exec-compressed' rule describes"

- p6, if possible it would be good to see more detailed numbers from
  CPU performance counters to help understand when and why the
  technique is effective.  How does the cache performance change?
  Presumably the baseline decompress-transform-recompress is working
  on a frame-by-frame basis rather than needing to write large
  temporary files to disk?

- I would like to see measurements of how much decompression you have
  to do to get the necessarily alignments, partly to verify that the
  experiments you are reporting cover this case.

- Comment on application to bzip2

Not changing:
-------------
- pop/push to input/output (is anyone ever confused?  pop is shorter)
- results - possibly describe 1x,1x case on scatter plot

After submission:
-----------------

- EXAMPLES of transformations
  - add source-to-source StreamIt transformation?

- explore lightweight re-compression

- look at more mencoder transformations
    - autolevels, IIR filters, FIR filters, etc.

- get breakdown of time spent processing vs. time spent re-compressing
  - can't really explain why encode_frame is so high (e.g., noop/inverse/screencast1)
  - delete *.so* in ffmpeg directory and rebuild blender to link
  --> could also compare runtime to Raw video output (Viktor)

Now obsolete
------------

- if you combined intra-align and inter-align, could you get better
  compression?  Maybe intra-align expands LCM's too far
