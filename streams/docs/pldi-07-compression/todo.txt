Before submission:
------------------

- EXAMPLES of transformations

- abstract: 
  - Apple Animation not "based on" LZ77
  - speedup only proportional to compression ratio for pixel transforms

- results:
  - backwards pointer to apple animation
  - possibly describe 1x,1x case on scatter plot
  - add pictures of video frames?

After submission:
-----------------

- if you combined intra-align and inter-align, could you get better
  compression?  Maybe intra-align expands LCM's too far

- look at more mencoder transformations
    - autolevels, IIR filters, FIR filters, etc.

- get breakdown of time spent processing vs. time spent re-compressing
  - can't really explain why encode_frame is so high (e.g., noop/inverse/screencast1)
  - delete *.so* in ffmpeg directory and rebuild blender to link
