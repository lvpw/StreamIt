Before submission:
------------------


Not changing:
-------------
- pop/push to input/output (is anyone ever confused?  pop is shorter)
- results - possibly describe 1x,1x case on scatter plot

After submission:
-----------------

- EXAMPLES of transformations
  - add source-to-source StreamIt transformation?

- saman comments
  - can you do selective decompression in some cases?

- if you combined intra-align and inter-align, could you get better
  compression?  Maybe intra-align expands LCM's too far

- look at more mencoder transformations
    - autolevels, IIR filters, FIR filters, etc.

- get breakdown of time spent processing vs. time spent re-compressing
  - can't really explain why encode_frame is so high (e.g., noop/inverse/screencast1)
  - delete *.so* in ffmpeg directory and rebuild blender to link
  --> could also compare runtime to Raw video output (Viktor)
