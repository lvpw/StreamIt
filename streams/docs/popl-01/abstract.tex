We characterize high-performance streaming applications as a new and
distinct domain of programs that is becoming increasingly important.
The StreaMIT language provides novel high-level representations to
improve programmer productivity and program robustness within the
streaming domain.  At the same time, the StreaMIT compiler aims to
improve the performance of streaming applications via stream-specific
analyses and optimizations.  In this paper, we motivate, describe and
justify the language features of StreaMIT, which include: a structured
model of streams, a messaging system for control, a re-initialization
mechanism, and a natural textual syntax.  We also present a means of
reasoning about time in terms of ``information flow'': a concept that
we believe is fundamental to the streaming domain.  Using this
concept, we give a formal semantics for StreaMIT's messaging system,
as well as a simple algorithm for detecting deadlock and buffer
overlow.
