\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

This paper presents StreaMIT, a novel language for high-performance
streaming applications.  Streaming programs are an emerging class of
very important applications with distinct properties from other
recognized application classes.

StreaMIT aims to raise the abstraction level in stream programming,
thereby improving programmer productivity and program robustness. This
paper presents fundamental programming constructs for the Stream
application domain. It identifies information flow as the natural
model for reasoning about streaming applications, and presents a
formal definition of the language using a semantics of time for
StreaMIT.

The second goal of StreaMIT is to provide a compiler that performs
stream-specific optimizations to achieve the performance of an expert
assembly programmer. Currently, a library-based implementation of
StreaMIT is working. We are starting the development of the first
compiler implementation of StreaMIT. Another area of future research
is to develop a clean high-level syntax for StreaMIT. The Java-based
syntax has many advantages, including programmer familiarity,
availability of compiler frameworks and a robust language
specification. However, the resulting StreaMIT syntax is cumbersome.
