non-formatting changes during CASES submission:
- an n became $n$
- managable -> manageable
- title of Section 3, "state-space analysis" -> "state space analysis"
- reverse order of first x, y equation (x comes first)
- reverse order of x, y equations in example figure
- say in statespace example, changes value to 1 in "B and C" not "D"
- replace - by -- :  "themselves---the specifics are covered"
- "used for to fill" --> "used to fill"
- Since the output of $\mathrm{R_1}$ (i.e., $\vc{\mathbf{y_1}}$) is
equivalent to the input of $\mathrm{R_2}$ (i.e., $\vc{\mathbf{u_2}}$),
we can write:
- This directly eliminates computations, as the compiler statically
evaluates $0 \cdot x = 0$ and $1 \cdot x = x$ rather than performing a
multiplication at runtime.
- "-" to "---" in optimization
- all vector symbols shifted to right.  vector symbol doesn't cover u_pre
  - should be {\vec u}_pre instead of {\vec u_pre}
- FIXED: stored inputs are always updated as shown in the same manner ???
  --> and what is "(3.1)"?
- FIXED: "updated as mentioned in (3.1)" ???

-----------------------------------

n improve typesetting of u1_new, o2_new in statespace.tex?

n see if inputs really have to be converted to states for
  optimization

n strengthen conclusion
