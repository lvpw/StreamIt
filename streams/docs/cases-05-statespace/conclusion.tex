As embedded applications come to support more and more functionality,
the software will inevitably become more complex, and it will soon be
unmanageable to satisfy tight resource constraints via manual tuning
of low-level DSP code.  In order to replace the signal processing
expert in the design flow, compilers need to incorporate
domain-specific knowledge and have a clean, unified framework for
representing and optimizing the application.  This paper presents one
such framework, which is based on linear state space systems.  Our
framework provides for general extraction, expansion, and combination
of state space representations.

Using state space analysis, we develop two novel optimizations for
stream programs: state removal and parameter reduction.  These
transformations radically alter the internal data space of the program
while maintaining the proper input/output relationship.  Such
transformations are generally infeasible in languages such as C due to
aliasing and global variables.  We implement the optimizations as part
of StreamIt, a high-level stream language based on the synchronous
dataflow model.  Our implementation demonstrates increased generality
over plain linear optimizations.
