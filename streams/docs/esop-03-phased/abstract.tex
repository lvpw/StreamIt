Applications that are structured around some notion of a "stream"
are becoming increasingly important and widespread.  There is
evidence that streaming media applications are already consuming
most of the cycles on consumer machines \cite{Rix98}, and their
use is continuing to grow.  {\StreamIt} is a language and compiler
specifically designed for modern stream programming.  Despite the
prevalence of these applications, there is surprisingly little
language and compiler for practical, large-scale stream
programming.  {\StreamIt} is a language and compiler specifically
designed for modern stream programming.  The {\StreamIt} langauge
holds two goals: first, to provide high-level stream abstractions
that improve programmer productivity and program robustness within
the streaming domain; second, to serve as a common machine
language for grid-based processors.  At the same time, {\StreamIt}
compiler aims to perform stream-specific optimizations to achieve
the performance of an expert programmer.  This thesis develops
several techniques for scheduling execution of {\filters} in
{\StreamIt}.  The work focuses on correctness as well as
minimizing buffering requirements and stored schedule size.
