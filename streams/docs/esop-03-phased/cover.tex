% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.
\newpage
% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.
% \pagestyle{empty}
\setcounter{savepage}{\thepage}
\begin{abstractpage}
\input{abstract}
\end{abstractpage}

% Additional copy: start a new page, and reset the page number.  This way,
% the second copy of the abstract is not counted as separate pages.
% Uncomment the next 6 lines if you need two copies of the abstract
% page.

\subsection*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my advisor for infinite patience and guidance. The {\StreamIt} team has been invaluable
in both the research and writing. Bill Thies helped me with many initial ideas and literature search. Michael Gordon
provided the best testing environment by writing the front end for our compiler and embedding the scheduler in his 
RAW backend. David Maze contributed to the internal compiler framework, and help with our printing of program graphs.
Jasper Lin hacked our compiler to no end. Chris Leger, Ali Meli, Andrew Lamb and Jeremy Wong wrote scores of
applications which I could use for testing.

I want to thank my officemates and friends for putting up with me and convincing me that there is an end to writing.
They were right.

Most importantly, I want to thank my all my family and friends, for helping me get here in the first place, 
and providing constant support.
