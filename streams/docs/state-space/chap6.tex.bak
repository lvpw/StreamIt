\chapter{Related Work}

    This thesis builds directly on the work done to analyze and
optimize linear components in StreamIt graphs \cite{Lamb}. We have
extended the theoretical framework for linear analysis to
state-space analysis in order to apply our optimizations to a
wider class of applications.

    Many other groups are researching methods for automated DSP
application optimizations. SPIRAL \cite{} is a system developed to
generate libraries of DSP transforms. These libraries are designed
for specific architectures, and can be re-optimized when hardware
is upgraded or replaced.
