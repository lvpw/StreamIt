Dear William Thies,

please find below the promised comments for your HPCA-WiP
abstract. We hope you'll find them helpful and please try
to follow the suggestions in your final submission.

Please also note the following points:

+ The early registration deadline has been extended to 1/17.

+ WIP presenters need to register for the conference.

+ The eight-minute presentation limit will be strictly enforced.

+ Presenters are reminded that the session is supposed to be FUN,
  and so humor and levity in the presentation is STRONGLY
  encouraged (indeed, required!).

+ In case your abstract has multiple authors, please let us know
  who will be presenting.

+ Please let us know your preferred shirt size in the event that
  we are able to make WIP T-shirts (this isn't certain yet).

+ Let us know if you need any special equipment beyond what the
  conference provides for other sessions.

+ Your abstracts will appear in the June issue of the ACM SIGARCH
  Computer Architecture News - in order to make this possible we
  will need a revised, properly formatted, and camera-ready version
  of your abstract by March 15th. We will send some additional
  formatting instructions soon via email.

In case you have any further questions, please send email to
hpcawip@in.tum.de.

Looking forward to seeing you in Boston,
Best regards,

  Koji Inoue, Martin Schulz, Bruce Childers, and Sally McKee

Here are the reviews from HPCA-WiP 2002 for the paper:
A Common Machine Language for Grid-Based Architectures

Review#:                523
Appropriateness:        5
Originality:            3
Technical Strength:     4
Presentation:           4
Overall:                5

Detailed Comments:
I believe this paper is very suitable to the Work-in-Progress session since
 hot discussion can be expected at the workshop. The discussion will be very
 beneficial for both the authors and audience there.

Review#:                538
Appropriateness:        3
Originality:            2
Technical Strength:     4
Presentation:           4
Overall:                3

Detailed Comments:
The authors propose a new low-level, machine independent language for
so-called grid-based architectures (here a little more introduction
would be helpful in order to avoid the confusion with computational
Grids). The work is very well presented and motivated, however, I am
not sure how original this work is, as the language has been
published before.

Review#:                557
Appropriateness:        4
Originality:            4
Technical Strength:     4
Presentation:           4
Overall:                4

Detailed Comments:
Should make for an interesting presentation if the authors can
keep it focused and within the eight-minute limit. It'll be
especially interesting if Dally/Horowitz and Burger/Keckler
(and some vocal students :) are at the session.
