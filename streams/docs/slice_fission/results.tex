\section{Results}

We are not going to get perfect linear scaling for each benchmark
because of symmetries between the application and the
architecture. For example, FilterBank ?? X ?? has a task-parallel
level with 8 filters, targeting a 36-core machine configuration, we
cannot do better than to parallelize these each filter of the level 4
ways, for a total of 32 filters....
