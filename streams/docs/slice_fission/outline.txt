*Intro
** Multicore
Moore's law exposed to software
Burden to software layer for single-program performance gains
** Stream Programming
Good solution: regular and repeating comm, with independent filters
Global transformations possible
Data parallelism is a good technique because it offers computational
scalability but could introduce lots of communication, have to be careful
Many filters in streaming domain are stateless but the language	  

Peeking



** Sliding window computation
Hank's blurb
What happens when we parallelize with communication patterns


*Stream Programming
** Overview of stream programming

** Overview of peeking
Example peeking filter
 

***Static rates
