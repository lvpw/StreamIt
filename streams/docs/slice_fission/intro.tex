\section{Introduction}
This is the intro~\cite{bakshi99}.

The sliding window pattern is found in a variety of application
domains including digital signal processing, image processing, video
encoding, and network processing.  In digital signal processing,
sliding window computations are used to implement digital filters
including finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response
(IIR) filters~\cite{NR92}.  In image processing, sliding window
computations are also used for edge detection, image sharpening and
blurring, and other image filtering
operations~\cite{Ziou97edgedetection}.  In video processing, the
sliding window pattern is commonly used in H.264 and other video
encoders as part of the motion estimation
process~\cite{Richardson03,BK97}.  Finally, in network processing,
sliding windows can be used to string matching algorithms for deep
packet inspection~\cite{Fisk02}.

fissing peaking filters is very important because we prevented from
coarsening peeking filter with anything upstream (state). So after
coarsening, we are left with either filters large stateless, stateless
peeking, or stateful filters.
