\section{Tilera Tile64}

The TILE64 Processor, produced by Tilera Corporation, is a 64 core
system on a chip~\cite{Tilera08}.  Each core is an identical
three-wide VLIW capable of running SMP Linux.  In addition to standard
RISC instructions, all cores support a SIMD instruction set designed
to accelerate video, image and digital signal processing applications.
Each core has 64KB L2 cache, and L2 caches can be shared among cores
to provide an effective 4MB of shared L3 cache.  Cores are connected
through five low-latency, two-dimensional mesh interconnects.  Two of
these networks carry user data, while the other three handle memory
and I/O. The combination of mechanisms allows the TILE64 Processor to
support both the shared memory and message passing programming
paradigms.
