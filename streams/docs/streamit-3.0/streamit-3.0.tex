\section{Document Overview}

This  document describes  language  extensions to  StreamIt. The  core
emphasis  is  on  language  features  that enable  variable  I/O  rate
declarations,  stream  graph  re-initialization, and  dynamic  control
flow.  In general, this document follows the structure of the StreamIt
2.0  language  specification,  and  only describes  the  new  language
features (with  references to the  existing syntax and  runtime system
where necessary).

\section{Variable Input/Output Rate}

All  computation  in  StreamIt  occurs within  filters.   Each  filter
consists  of an initialization  (init) function  and a  work function.
The work function  must declare its I/O rate  consisting of
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it peek}~\texttt{expression}\\the number of items---per
  iteration---the work function may examine from its input tape,
\item {\it pop }~\texttt{expression}\\the number of items---per
  iteration---the work function  removes from its input tape,
\item {\it push}~\texttt{expression}\\the number of items---per
  iteration---the work function places on its  output tape.
\end{itemize}
The {\it peek} expression represents  the maximum number of items that
a filter may inspect, whereas the {\it pop} and {\it push} expressions
are binding  in that  the work function  must consume and  produce the
exact number of items specified in the rate declaration.

Alternative,  a work function  may declare  an I/O  rate that  spans a
range  of  values  (i.e.,  if a  filter  inspects/consumes/produces  a
different number of items per iteration of the work function):
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it peek}~\texttt{[min, max]:avg}
\item {\it pop }~\texttt{[min, max]:avg}
\item {\it push}~\texttt{[min, max]:avg}
\end{itemize}
where  \texttt{min}, \texttt{max},  and  \texttt{avg} are  expressions
that respectively represent the {\it minimum}, {\it maximum}, and {\it
average}  I/O  rates\footnote{Note  the   brackets  are  part  of  the
syntax. Also note that the  syntax for specifying a message latency is
similar,  and  uses  a  colon  instead  of a  comma  to  separate  the
\texttt{min}  and \texttt{max}  expressions;  should we  use the  same
syntax  here for  consistency?}.  A  $*$  may replace  the minimum  or
maximum  peek/pop/push rate  expressions to  respectively  indicate an
unbound lower  limit or an  unbound upper limit\footnote{Lets  not use
left and  right parentheses when  indicating an unbound  limit.  Also,
note that  a range of  [$*$, $*$] is  allowed, as in  {\it push}~[$*$,
$*$] but  this is really equivalent  to {\it push}~$*$  and perhaps we
want to allow that syntax as a special case, with say {\it push}~$*$:5
implying an unbound I/O rate with an average of five items produced.}.

The following relation  must hold when appropriate: 0  $\le$ {\it min}
$\le$ {\it avg}  $\le$ {\it max}. If a rate  expression evaluates to a
negative value, the system may  raise an exception and the behavior of
the  application  is undefined.   Furthermore,  if  the work  function
violates its I/O  rate declaration---that is, it pops  or pushes fewer
items than  its declared  minimum rate, or  more items than  a bounded
maximum rate---the system may raise  an exception, and the behavior of
the application is undefined.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Alternate Syntax for Variable Input/Output Rate}

Alternatively, a  work function may declare  an I/O rate  that spans a
range of values as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it peek}~\texttt{min:avg:max}
\item {\it pop }~\texttt{min:avg:max}
\item {\it push}~\texttt{min:avg:max}
\end{itemize}
where  \texttt{min}, \texttt{max},  and  \texttt{avg} are  expressions
that respectively represent the {\it minimum}, {\it maximum}, and {\it
average} I/O  rates.  The average  rate (and encapsulating  colons) is
optional.  A $*$ may replace the maximum peek/pop/push rate expression
if  a  filter  inspects/consumes/produces  any  number  of  items  per
iteration, and in this case  the minimum rate expression and colon are
optional---if  specified, the peek/pop/push  rate is  considered bound
from below, and the  work function inspects/consumes/produces at least
\texttt{min} items per iteration.

\section{Splitters and Joiners}

In addition  to \texttt{duplicate} and  \texttt{roundrobin} splitters,
there are  three new splitters  that are geared toward  dynamic stream
behaviors.   The three  new types  of splitters  are \texttt{exclusive
switch},    \texttt{multiple   switch},    and    \texttt{set}.    The
\texttt{exclusive switch} splitter channels  input data to only one of
its  static  sibling streams.  The  \texttt{multioke switch}  splitter
channels  input data  to any  number of  its statically  defined child
streams,   and   it   may   operate   as   a   \texttt{duplicate}   or
\texttt{roundrobin} splitter.

{\bf Note:}  need to define how  the new splitters  interact with user
defined splitters, and joiners.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection {\texttt{exclusive switch} Splitters}

An \texttt{exclusive  switch} splitter has  a single input of  a given
type and multiple  outputs of the same type. However,  only one of the
output  tapes is enabled  at any  given time\footnote{Not  quite true!
While the  switch from one active  tape to another  is underway, there
are two  active tapes.}.  An \texttt{exclusive  switch} splitter takes
each incoming item  and pushes the same item to  the active or enabled
output tape.  The  following examples illustrate two \texttt{exclusive
switch} splitter definitions.
\begin{verbatim}
   float->float splitjoin Radio() {
     split exclusive switch(string mode);
     add FMradio() as switch(``fm'' :: disable);
     add AMradio() as switch(``am'' :: enable);
     join inorder;
   }
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
   float->float splitjoin ChannelBoosters(int channels, int lowFrequency, int frequencyStep) {
     split exclusive switch(int frequency);
     for (int i = 0; i < channels; i++) {
        int frequency = lowFrequency + (i * frequencyStep);
        add Booster(frequency) as switch(frequency :: (frequency == lowFrequency) ? enable : disable);
     }
     join inorder;
   }
\end{verbatim}

In the first example,  a \verb+splitjoin+ with two static alternatives
is    defined.    The   two    children    are   \verb+FMradio+    and
\verb+AMradio+. The \texttt{exculsive switch} keywords are followed by
an  argument list  that defines  the naming  convention for  the child
streams  that are added.  In this  case, the  child streams  are named
using strings.

Each child  stream that is  added {\it registers} itself  according to
the name specified as a parameter to \verb+switch+. The \verb+FMradio+
stream  is  thus registered  as  the ``fm''  stream.  At  the time  of
initialization,  the stream  is not  active, indicated  by  the double
colons  and  the keyword  \verb+disable+  following  the arguments  to
\verb+switch+.   In  this  example,  the ``am''  stream  is  initially
active. A \verb+switch+ splitter may only declare one stream as active
(using the \verb+enable+ keyword).

To  toggle the  switch, or  in other  words to  deactivate a  tape and
enable  another,  a {\it  reinitialization  message}  is  sent to  the
\verb+splitjoin+\footnote{The message is sent  to the splitter and the
joiner since both  must respond to a switch  request.} by invoking the
\verb+switch()+  method  on a  portal  where  the \verb+splitjoin+  is
registered:\\
\verb+  radioPortal.switch(``fm'' :: enable)+.\\
The \texttt{switch} invocation  must specify the appropriate parameter
expression  which is  a string  in this  case.  When  a new  stream is
enabled,  the previously  active stream  is automatically  drained and
then deactivated.

In  the  second  example,  an \texttt{exclusive  switch}  splitter  is
declared with several streams that are named using integer expressions
corresponding to the \verb+frequency+ variable, and the default active
stream is the  \verb+lowFrequency+ stream. 

The names assigned  to each stream must by  mutually exclusive: no two
streams can have the same name. If this naming convention is violated,
the system may raise an exception, and the behavior of the application
is undefined.

{\bf Note: If a default active stream is not specified, then the first
added stream is automatically activated after initialization.}

\subsection {\texttt{multiple switch} Splitters}

A \texttt{multiple switch} splitter has a single input of a given type
and multiple  outputs of the  same type. Unlike  the \texttt{exclusive
switch} splitter where only one of  the output tapes is enabled at any
given time, the \texttt{multiple switch} channels its incoming data to
any number  of active  child streams. The  data may be  duplicated, or
distributed   in  a   roundrobin  fashion.    The   following  example
illustrates a \texttt{multiple switch} splitter definition.
\begin{verbatim}
   float->float splitjoin GraphicsEffects(int Npixels) {
     split roundrobin(Npixels)  multiple switch(string mode);
     add Shade()      as switch(``shader''      :: enable);
     add Fog()        as switch(``fogger''      :: enable);
     add Blur()       as switch(``blur''        :: disable);
     add Illuminate() as switch(``illuminater'' :: disable);
     join inorder;
   }
\end{verbatim}

The splitter in the  example is a \texttt{roundrobin} \texttt{multiple
switch}.  It operates as a roundrobin splitter, passing \verb+Npixels+
at  a time to  each active  streams. A  stream that  is not  active is
ignored.  Here,  the   \texttt{multiple  switch}  defines  the  naming
convention,  and as  each child  stream is  added, it  is  either {\it
enabled} or  {\it disabled} using the  \verb+enable+ or \verb+disable+
modifier  following  the  naming  expression  in  the  \texttt{switch}
argument list. To enable or disable a stream dynamically, a message is
sent to the \verb+splitjoin+ that invokes the \texttt{switch} handler,
specifying          which         stream          to         toggle:\\
\verb+ graphicsPortal.switch(``blur'' :: enable)+.

A  \texttt{duplicate} \texttt{multiple switch}  is also  possible; the
following  reiterates  the previous  example  as a  \texttt{duplicate}
\texttt{multile switch} splitter.
\begin{verbatim}
   float->float splitjoin GraphicsEffects(int Npixels) {
     split duplicate multiple switch(string mode);
     add Shade()      as switch(``shader''      :: enable);
     add Fog()        as switch(``fogger''      :: enable);
     add Blur()       as switch(``blur''        :: disable);
     add Illuminate() as switch(``illuminater'' :: disable);
     join inorder;
   }
\end{verbatim}

Note that unlike in the  \texttt{exclusive switch}, here names are not
required to  be mutually  exclusive. This allows  for the  grouping of
multiple  streams into  a common  name, and  the entire  group  can be
enabled or disabled  simultaneously. During initialization, subsets of
the group may be enabled or disabled, but at runtime, the entire group
is toggled and the fine grain control is lost.

% {\bf Note:} shall we allow roundrobin weights to change dynamically?
% we have to support this for the \texttt{set} splitter anyway. A
% suggested syntax is
% \verb+multiswitch(parameter list :: weight, enable | disable)+.

% {\bf Alternative Syntax:} Rather than introduce a new keyword
% (\texttt{multiswitch}), we could unique the syntax with the exclusive
% switch. The latter can be declared as follows:\\
% \verb+split exclusive switch(...);+\\
% and the former can be declared as:\\
% \verb+split mutliple switch(...);+\\
% Then to toggle a stream, both splitters use the same message
% handler:\\
% \verb+portal.switch(stream :: enable | disable);\\
% with syntactic sugar for the exclusive switch where the enable/disable
% qualifier is optional (and by default the qualifier is to enable the
% specified stream). I like this syntax


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Compiler Hints}

A programmer  may pass hints to  the compiler to  allow for aggressive
optimizations or automatic specialization. The hints describe the {\it
alias} set  or the  set of streams  that may be  simultaneously active
within the \verb+splitjoin+. The alias  set is also annotated with the
aliasing probability. In the following example:
\begin{verbatim}
   float->float splitjoin GraphicsEffects(int Npixels) {
     split duplicate multiple switch(string mode);
     add Shade()      as switch(``shader''      :: enable)  aliases(``fogger''    : 1);
     add Fog()        as switch(``fogger''      :: enable)  aliases(``shader''    : 1);
     add Blur()       as switch(``blur''        :: disable) aliases(``luminater'' : 1);
     add Illuminate() as switch(``luminater''   :: disable) aliases(``blur''      : 0.5, ``fogger'' : 0);
     join inorder;
   }
\end{verbatim}
the programmer  indicates that  the ``shader'' and  ``fogger'' streams
operate in tandem:  if one is active,  so is the other, and  if one is
not active,  neither is the other.  Also, when the  ``blur'' stream is
active, the  ``luminater'' is also active, but  when the ``luminater''
is active,  the ``blur'' stream is  only active 50\% of  the time, and
the ``fogger'' is never active.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection {\texttt{set} Splitters}

There are still some issues to sort out.\\
1) i think all streams in a set should be of the same ``type''
(instances of the same stream class). but if we're pushing to define a
standard, why should we be restrictive. fine, if we try to go for the
more ``general'' language extension, the syntax gets less clean. i'm
still hashing through different ideas on paper.\\
2) if we go with the more restricted scheme, then a set splitter can
define the name of the stream it is intended for, just as with
portals. for example
\verb+split set<SomeStream(dynamic parameters)>(naming convention)+. Then to add a
new stream,
\verb+portal.set<SomeStream(parameters)>(name :: create)+ and to delete a
stream,
\verb+portal.set(name :: destroy)+. To retrieve the name of a stream, we provide
a special function that returns a list of name, along with an iterator
to process the list. Alternatively, we can go with the dynamic memory
allocation scheme (which i think we should provide regardless).\\
3) in the more general scheme, the splitter declaration could just be
\verb+split set<>(naming convention)+ and to add or delete a stream, we
can use the same syntax as in (2).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The \texttt{set} splitter offers  unbounded parallelism as streams can
be  added   (and  deleted)  at  runtime.   The  \texttt{set}  splitter
duplicates  its input  data to  all of  its  child streams\footnote{To
allow a \texttt{roundrobin} splitter,  the addition of stream requires
a  position directive.  Will  this be  necessary  for our  application
domain?}.

\begin{verbatim}
   float->float splitjoin CellPhoneBaseStation(int lowFrequency, int highFrequency) {
     split set(newCalls<int frequency);
     add someStream(lowFrequency) as set(lowFrequency);
     join inorder;
   }
\end{verbatim}

As with the other dynamic splitters, the \texttt{set} splitter defines
the naming conventions for streams that are added to the
\verb+splitjoin+. That is, \verb+set(int)+ defines a set of streams
that are named using integers. The stream order is arbitrary within
the \verb+splitjoin+.

To add a stream, a special handler is invoked on the
portal where the \verb+splitjoin+ is registered:
\verb+baseStationPortal.set.add(newCall(frequency, callType), frequency)

The \texttt{set} splitter also affords a mechanism for reinitializing
streams.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{\texttt{inorder} Joiners}

An \texttt{inorder}  joiner means that the wavefronts  arrive in order
following  a switch.


\section{Dynamic Stream Blocks}

Within  initialization  code of containers and 
filter  init functions,  access to  dynamic variables  and stream
parameters  (i.e., variables  with  values that  cannot be  statically
resolved)  is restricted  to 1)  the dynamic  argument lists  of child
streams,  and  2) explicit  {\it  dynamic} $\{$~$\ldots$~$\}$  blocks.
Dynamic blocks may not be nested, and further, within a dynamic block,
there can not  exist any modification to variables  or parameters that
are  visible outside the  dynamic block;  variables declared  within a
dynamic block are not visible  beyond the scope of the block.  Dynamic
variables and stream  arguments may appear in a  filter work function,
including  the I/O  rate declaration.   The following  illustrate some
examples.

\end{figure}

{\it Rationale.}   The use of a  dynamic block is in  keeping with the
structured format  of the StreamIt  language.  It also  avoids dynamic
type  and  inference  rules.   The  feature  allows  the  compiler  to
readily  interpret  static   initialization  code,  and  defer  the
evaluation of dynamic blocks to the runtime system.

%% \subsection{Dynamic Stream Parameters}

%% The  declaration  of a  dynamic  stream  parameter  may be  optionally
%% followed by  an annotation that decsribes  the {\it set}  of values the
%% parameter  may have  while the  program  executes. The  syntax for  an
%% annotation  is $\{ v_0  (p_0), v_1  (p_1), ...,  v_n (p_n)  \}$, where
%% $v_i$  represents  a  unique   value  for  the  parameter,  and  $p_i$
%% represents  the   probability  of  occurance  for   value  $v_i$;  the
%% probabilty   attribute---and   its   encasing   parenthesis---may   be
%% omitted. Each  value ($v_i$) in  the annotation must be  a statically
%% resolved expression of the same type as the parameter.  Similarly, the
%% probability attribute  must be a statically  resolved expression, such
%% that $0 \le p_i \le 1$, and  furthermore, the sum of all $p_i$ is $\le
%% 1$. The following illustrates an example.

%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% %%  \begin{center}

%% {\it Rationale.}   Annotation of  dynamic stream parameters  may allow
%% the  compiler to  specialize  a stream  in  the set  of  of values  is
%% manageable. It  may even be desirable  to allow the  annotation of any
%% variable,  thereby  allowing the  programmer  to formally  communicate
%% potentially important information to the compiler.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% \section{Variable Rate Annotations}

%% In  order  to  assist  the  compiler with  scheduling,  the  following
%% annotations  of a  streaming  rate  are allowed:  1)  an average  rate
%% attribute,  or 2)  a  set  of rates  and  associated probabilities  of
%% occurrence.    The  syntax   for   the  former   attribute  is   simply
%% $\{$\texttt{expr}$\}$ following the rate declaration. For example {\it
%% push}\texttt{[2:6]$\{$4$\}$} declares a  dynamic push rate between two
%% and  six  items, with  an  average rate  of  four  writes per  filter
%% iteration.

%% The syntax  for the  more elaborate annotation  is $\{r_0  (p_0), r_1
%% (p_1), ...,  r_n (p_n)\}$, where  $r_i$ represents a unique  rate, and
%% $p_i$  represents the  probability of  occurrence for  rate  $r_i$; the
%% probability attribute---and its encasing parenthesis---may be omitted.
%% Each  rate ($r_i$)  in the  annotation must  be a  statically resolved
%% expression, not less than the  declared minimum rate, nor greater than
%% the declared maximum  rate.  The probability attribute must  also be a
%% statically  resolved expression,  such that  $0  \le p_i  \le 1$,  and
%% furthermore,  the  sum  of  all   $p_i$  is  $\le  1$.  The  following
%% illustrates an example.

%% \begin{figure}[h]
%% %%  \begin{center}
%%   \vspace{-10pt}

%% 	  \end{tabbing}

%% %%  }
%% %%  \end{center}
%%   \vspace{-10pt}
%% \end{figure}

%% {\it Rationale.} The annotation  is intended to provide the programmer
%% with  a  methodology  for  communicating information  about  a  stream
%% component  to the  compiler.  Such  information may  potentially guide
%% optimizations,  in particular  scheduling, work  estimation,  and load
%% balancing.  The same  approach to annotation may also  be desirable in
%% the  context  of  dynamic  stream  parameters and  arguments,  as  the
%% information   may   allow  the   compiler   to  perform   control-flow
%% specialization.

%% Add proposal for procedural rate specifications.

%% \section{User-Programmable SplitJoins}

%% User-defined splitters and joiners.  I'll take David Maze's example
%% from before:

%% \begin{verbatim}
%%      float->float joiner DotProductJoiner(int M, int N) {
%%        work pop roundrobin(N) push 1 {
%%          float sum = 0.0;
%%          for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
%%            float prod = 1.0;
%%            for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
%%              prod *= pop(j);
%%            }
%%            sum += prod;
%%          }
%%          push(sum);
%%        }
%%      }
%% \end{verbatim}

%% He introduces a pop(j), peek(j, index) and push(j, value) functions to
%% pop, peek, or push on a given output tape.  I think this is ok.

%% Open questions:

%% - how to specify range of rates on multiple-input joiners?  Can you
%%   specify that you read i items from the i'th tape?  Or just that all
%%   have the same value?

\section{Stream Parameters}

A  stream may  be parameterized  using a  list of  variables  that are
specified when the stream  is created or reinitialized. The parameters
may  be static---with  values resolved  at compile  time---or dynamic,
with values that are not known to the compiler. The syntax for
declaring a parameter list is dependent on the nature of
arguments. Specifically,
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Static parameters are delimited with $\<$ and $\>$.
\item 
  Dynamic  parameters are delimited with parentheses following the
  list of static parameters.
\end{enumerate}

The syntax is not backward-compatible, but we can release a simple
converter to translate existing StreamIt programs to the new syntax.

\section{Statements}

The keyword {\bf mutable}  must follow any initialization statements
that  add  a  child   stream  with  dynamic  arguments  (i.e.,  stream
constructors); if the stream may undergo reinitialization.  
The keyword will create a switch splitter whose first child stream is
the added container, and it is by default the activate
stream. Mutable containers must be registered with a portal.

	    \>// add a stream with static and dynamic arguments\\
	    \>add {\bf mutable} compress $<$int $static\_parameter$$>$ (int $dynamic\_parameter$); in portal\\
	    \>$\ldots$\\

\end{figure}

Mutable containers have a default message handler \texttt{mutate} with a signature
that is the same as the added stream less any static parameters (i.e.,
only dynamic parameters are allowed to change). To mutate a container,
the \texttt{mutate} method is invoked as if it were a message. The
mutation rexecutes the stream initialization code, and the new stream
is added to the switch splitter created in the parent container (!!!
certain portals must not have more than one registered component
now!!!), and the switch splitter toggles the active stream to the new
component (the semantics of the switch splitter apply for draining the
active stream, etc.)

\section{Additional Primitive Types}

In addition to  the existing primitive types, the following new types
are introduced:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf String} type is introduced. The String type is  only in parameter and
argument lists (for stream components and functions) and .

To express a variable I/O rate 
A rate  expression is {\it static}  if it is  a compile-time constant,
and it is {\it dynamic} otherwise.


The example in Figure~\ref{fig:rates}  illustrates an example I/O rate
using the new  language syntax. The work function  may inspect between
three and  $N$ items, and  it consumes an  average of three  items per
iteration.  The work function may not always produce an output and may
write an unspecified number of data items to its output tape, although
it averages three outputs per iteration.
