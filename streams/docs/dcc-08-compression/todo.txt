- verify that I'm citing the right Navarro papers

Not changing:
-------------
- change \mbox{floor} to floor symbols?  or make floor/min bold?
- pop/push to input/output (is anyone ever confused?  pop is shorter)

After submission:
-----------------
- explore lightweight re-compression
- look at more mencoder transformations
    - autolevels, IIR filters, FIR filters, etc.
- get breakdown of time spent processing vs. time spent re-compressing
  - can't really explain why encode_frame is so high (e.g., noop/inverse/screencast1)
  - delete *.so* in ffmpeg directory and rebuild blender to link
  --> could also compare runtime to Raw video output (Viktor)
