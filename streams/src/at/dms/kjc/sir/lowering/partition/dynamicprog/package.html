<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.dynamicprog</title>

<p>
Adjusts the granularity of the stream graph, using a dynamic
programming algorithm to optimize the load balancing.  The algorithm
used is described in a yet-unpublished draft (contact
<tt>thies@alum.mit.edu</tt>) and is similar to the dynamic programming
partitioner described in this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03</a>
paper (see Section 6.2).

<p>The general strategy behind the algorithm is to calculate, for each
hierarchical stream, the bottleneck work if that stream were spread
across <em>n</em> processors.  If this information is available for a
set of sub-streams, then a parent stream can recursively calculate its
bottleneck for a given <em>n</em> by assigning some of the <em>n</em>
processors to some children and the rest of the processors to the
other children.  Generally speaking, the best partitioning is taken as
the minimum bottleneck across all possible allocations of processors
across all divisions of children.

<p>The dynamic programming partitioner uses <em>rectangles</em> as a
uniform representation of streams.  An <em>n</em>-element pipeline is
a rectangle that has a width of 1 and a height of <em>n</em>, while a
splitjoin of <em>n</em> filters is a rectangle with a width of
<em>n</em> and a height of 1.  Splitjoins containing pipelines are
represented as a single rectangle.  Using this representation, the
partitioning algorithm can assign any sub-rectangle to a single
processor and implement the fusion using a hierarchical refactoring of
the splitjoin.

<p>To support the rectangle abstraction, all filters and streams are
wrapped in <em>configurations</em>.  The basic configuration is {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.dynamicprog.DPConfig}, and there is
a subclass for each stream type.  The standard dynamic programming
methods of <tt>get()</tt> (to calculate the partitioning costs for a
sub-stream) and
<tt>traceback()</tt> (to reconstruct the minimal-cost partitioning)
are implemented by each type of configuration.  The heart of the
algorithm is in {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.dynamicprog.DPConfigContainer},
which implements these two functions for arbitrary rectangles.

<p>The high-level interface for the package is {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.dynamicprog.DynamicProgPartitioner},
which contains constants and configuration-building code.
