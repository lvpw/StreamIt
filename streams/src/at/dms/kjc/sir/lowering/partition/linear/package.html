<p>
Applies linear optimizations to the stream graph, using a dynamic
programming algorithm to calculate the most profitable set of
transformations.  The transformations considered are algebraic
combination of linear nodes and translation of linear nodes to the
frequency domain.  A partitioning algorithm is needed because these
transformations are not always profitable; furthermore,
non-neighboring filters may need to be considered at once to gauge
profitability.

<p>
The linear partitioning algorithm is described in Section 6.2 of this
<a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03</a>
paper.

<p>The general strategy behind the algorithm is to calculate, for each
hierarchical stream, the estimated runtime if that stream was
algebraically collapsed, translated to the frequency domain, or left
alone.  If this information is available for a set of sub-streams,
then a parent stream can recursively calculate these estimates as a
composition of the child estimates.

<p>The dynamic programming partitioner uses <em>rectangles</em> as a
uniform representation of streams.  An <em>n</em>-element pipeline is
a rectangle that has a width of 1 and a height of <em>n</em>, while a
splitjoin of <em>n</em> filters is a rectangle with a width of
<em>n</em> and a height of 1.  Splitjoins containing pipelines are
represented as a single rectangle.  Using this representation, the
partitioning algorithm can perform a linear optimization on any
sub-rectangle, and implement the transformation using a hierarchical
refactoring of the splitjoin.

<p>To support the rectangle abstraction, all filters and streams are
wrapped in <em>configurations</em>.  The basic configuration is {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.linear.LDPConfig}, and there is
a subclass for each stream type.  The standard dynamic programming
methods of <tt>get()</tt> (to calculate the partitioning costs for a
sub-stream) and
<tt>traceback()</tt> (to reconstruct the minimal-cost partitioning)
are implemented by each type of configuration.  The heart of the
algorithm is in {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.linear.LDPConfigContainer}, which
implements these two functions for arbitrary rectangles.

<p>The high-level interface for the package is {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.linear.LinearPartitioner}, which
contains constants and configuration-building code.
