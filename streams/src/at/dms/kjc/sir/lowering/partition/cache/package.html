<p>
Fuses filters in the stream graph while respecting instruction and
data cache constraints.  This package corresponds to the "cache aware
fusion" algorithm described in Section 4.2 of this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/05/sermulins-lctes05.pdf">LCTES'05</a>
paper.  

<p>While the code in this package evolved from the dynamic programming
partitioner, the final algorithm utilized here is greedy.
