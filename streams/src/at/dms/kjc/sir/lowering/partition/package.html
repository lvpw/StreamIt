<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Provides algorithms for adjusting the granularity of the stream graph
to improve load balancing or optimization potential.  Also provides
estimation of the work requirements of filters, as well as refactoring
routines that adjust the synchronization points in a stream graph.
The high-level partitioners can be broadly categorized as those that
improve load balancing and those that optimize other metrics.  

<p>
The partitioners oriented towards <b>load balancing</b> include:
<ul>

<li> {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.dynamicprog.DynamicProgPartitioner}.
This partitioner (currently the default used by strc) uses a dynamic
programming algorithm to calculate the most load-balanced refactoring
and fusion/fission of filters.  It is described in a yet-unpublished
draft (contact <tt>thies@alum.mit.edu</tt>) and is similar to the
dynamic programming partitioner described in this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03</a>
paper (see Section 6.2).

<p><li> {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.GreedyPartitioner}. One
of the first and still most robust partitioners, it iteratively
identifies the stream <em>container</em> containing the least amount
of work, and collapses that container into a single filter.

<p><li> {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.GreedierPartitioner}.
This partitioner is faster and more fair than the greedy partitioner.
Rather than collapsing the container with the smallest amount of work,
it iteratively collapses the pair of adjacent filters that have the
smallest amount of work.

<p><li> {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.ILPPartitioner}. This
partitioner is obsolete.  It translated the load balancing problem
into a linear program, but proved too slow to be practical.

</ul>

Partitioners that have <b>other optimization metrics</b> include:
<ul>

<li> {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.linear.LinearPartitioner}.  As part
of linear analysis and optimization, this partitioner decides which
filters should be algebraically combined or translated to the
frequency domain.  As it also utilizes a dynamic programming
algorithm, it can be considered a "dynamic programming partitioner".
For details, see Section 6.2 of this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03</a>
paper.

<p><li> {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.cache.CachePartitioner}.  This
partitioner greedily fuses filters based on cache constraints
(instruction size and data size).  It implements the "cache aware
fusion" algorithm described in Section 4.2 of this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/05/sermulins-lctes05.pdf">LCTES'05</a>
paper.

<p><li> {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.ManualPartition}.  This
partitioner provides an interface for programmers to manually drive
the partitioning process.  It can apply both to load balancing, and
other transformations.

</ul>
Several of these inherit from {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.ListPartitioner} to reuse some
common code.

<p>
The other files in this package fall under a few categories:

<ul>
<li>All files ending with <tt>Transform</tt> (inheriting from {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.StreamTransform}) represent a
symbolic transformation to be applied to a stream graph.  These are
generated as output from any partitioner based on dynamic programming,
because it is simpler (and easier to debug) than mutating the stream
graph in place.

<p><li>The {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.WorkEstimate} class
(and helper files <tt>Work*</tt>) provides an estimation of the number
of cycles needed to execute a filter.

<p><li>The {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.RefactorPipeline},
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.RefactorSplitJoin}, and
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.SJToPipe} classes perform
refactoring of hierarchical stream graphs.  As the fusion passes
generally operate on a single stream container at a time, the location
of container boundaries often needs to adjusted to perform various
partitionings.  Refactoring is done by the dynamic programming
partitioners.

</ul>
