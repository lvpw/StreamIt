<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Provides compiler passes that analyze or optimize the SIR, primarily
within the code of each filter.  

<p>Also contains {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Flattener}, the entry
point for the original (and mostly obsolete) uniprocessor backend.
Other files in this directory that are used solely by this backend
include {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Structurer}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.LowerInitFunctions}, and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.LowerWorkFunctions}.  They can be ignored for
the sake of most compiler development.

<p>This package also provides the primary interface from the compiler
to the scheduler (in {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.SIRScheduler}).
While some other parts of the compiler call the scheduler as well (for
example, to calculate messaging constraints), this class provides the
fundamental operation of calculating execution multiplicities for a
set of filters.

<p>The remaining files in this package perform various node-level
transformations on the IR.  They can be broadly categorized into
passes that are often necessary for correctness, vs. passes that
affect only performance or readability.

<p>Passes that are needed (at least in part) due to <b>correctness</b>:

<ul>
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ArrayInitExpander}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp} 
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstructSIRTree}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.EnqueueToInitPath}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldInitMover}  Moves field initialization from field declaration into the beginning of init().
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldProp}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.InlinePhases}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RemoveDynamicRates}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RemoveMultiPops} changes pop(N) into N pop() instructions for back ends that do not generate code for pop(N).
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RenameAll}  Makes all variable names unique.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RoundToFloor}  Converts round(x) to floor(x+0.5) so that C and Java code produce the same results.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.StaticsProp}  Propagates values of fields defined in static{...} into filters that use them.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.VarDeclRaiser}
</ul>

Several of these passes are run in all backends to prepare the program
for processing by the compiler.  For example, the first step in
building the stream graph is to use {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldProp} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller} to statically evaluate the contents
of the <tt>init</tt> function.  The {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstructSIRTree} pass verifies that this
process is complete and cements the graph structure.  Note that {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller} is also used to further optimize the
<tt>work</tt> function if unrolling is enabled.

<p>In contrast, passes that are used strictly for <b>performance</b>
or <b>readability</b> include:

<ul>
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ArrayDestroyer}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.BranchAnalyzer}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.DeadCodeElimination}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FindTapeOps}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.MarkFilterBoundaries} Inserts special marker instructions allowing a filter's code to be found after fusion.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.PopToPeek}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RenameDestroyedVars}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.StructDestroyer}
</ul>

<p>The {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FilterPhaser} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.DataFlow} classes do not appear in either of
the previous lists because they are not currently utilized by the
compiler.

<p> Some classes in this package are usually invoked from other passes.

<ul>
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Propagator} which performs constant propagation, copy propagation, and algebraic and boolean simplification is called from {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldProp} and {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller} are called as needed from {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp} for propagating parameters through the stream graph.
</ul>
