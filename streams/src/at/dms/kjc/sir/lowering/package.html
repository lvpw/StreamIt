<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Provides compiler passes that analyze or optimize the SIR, primarily
within the code of each filter.  

<p>Also contains {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Flattener}, the entry
point for the original (and mostly obsolete) uniprocessor backend.
Other files in this directory that are used solely by this backend
include {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Structurer}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.LowerInitFunctions}, and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.LowerWorkFunctions}.  They can be ignored for
the sake of most compiler development.

<p>This package also provides the primary interface from the compiler
to the scheduler (in {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.SIRScheduler}).
While some other parts of the compiler call the scheduler as well (for
example, to calculate messaging constraints), this class provides the
fundamental operation of calculating execution multiplicities for a
set of filters.

<p>The remaining files in this package perform various node-level
transformations on the IR.  They can be broadly categorized into
passes that are often necessary for correctness, vs. passes that
affect only performance or readability.

<p>Passes that are needed (at least in part) due to <b>correctness</b>:

<ul>
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ArrayInitExpander} Support reading initial values for arrays from files at compile time.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp} Constant Propagation and algebraic simplification.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstructSIRTree} Removes SITInitStatement, creating SIR tree representation.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.EnqueueToInitPath} Sets up "initPath" functions to translate the enqueue statements in FeedbackLoops.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldInitMover}  Moves field initialization from field declaration into the beginning of init().
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldProp} Sometimes called from ConstantProp, but also separately. Why?
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.InlinePhases}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Propagator} Lower level of ConstantProp, also performs some algebraic and boolean simplification.  Normally called from ConstantProp.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RemoveMultiPops} changes pop(N) into N pop() instructions for back ends that do not generate code for pop(N).
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RenameAll}  Makes all variable names unique.  Prerequisite for most other passes.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RoundToFloor}  Converts round(x) to floor(x+0.5) so that C and Java code produce the same results.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.StaticsProp}  Propagates values of fields defined in static{...} into filters that use them.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller} Sometimes called from ConstantProp to find more constants by unrolling loops.  Sometimes called separately.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.VarDeclRaiser}
</ul>

Several of these passes are run in all backends to prepare the program
for processing by the compiler.  For example, the first step in
building the stream graph is to use {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldProp} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller} to statically evaluate the contents
of the <tt>init</tt> function.  The {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstructSIRTree} pass verifies that this
process is complete and cements the graph structure.  Note that {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller} is also used to further optimize the
<tt>work</tt> function if unrolling is enabled.

<p>In contrast, passes that are used strictly for <b>performance</b>
or <b>readability</b> include:

<ul>
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ArrayDestroyer} Convert arrays that are only referenced at constant offsets into individual variables.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.BranchAnalyzer}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.CollapseDataParallelism} Collapse split-joins with user-specified data parallelism if the result can be re-expanded with {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fission.StatelessDuplicate}.  May result in substantially smaller graph during compilation.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.DeadCodeElimination} (Beware! hashes on Kopi constructs that generally have identity-based hashes.  Make sure you share all JVariableDefinition's.)
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FindTapeOps} Utility to determine if a compilation uint references an input or output tape.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.IntroduceMultiPops} Combines adjacent pop() and pop(N) instructions.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.MarkFilterBoundaries} Inserts special marker instructions allowing a filter's code to be found after fusion.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.PopToPeek} Convert pop() to peek(index++).  Must be followed with call to ConstantProp.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RenameDestroyedVars} Adjust live ranges.  Used after ArrayDestroyer (and StructDestroyer?).
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.SimplifyArguments} Use ThreeAddressCode to ensure that function arguments have no side effects.  Useful for implementing functions as macros.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.SimplifyPopPeekPush} Use ThreeAddressCode to ensure that all pushes, pops, peeks occur as separate statements.  Required for {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.VectorizeEnable}.  Since works in left-to-right manner, has some semantic effect in ordering multiple pops within a single expression.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.StructDestroyer} Convert structures into individual variables as much as possible.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ThreeAddressCode} Convert specified constructs to three-address code.
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.VectorizeEnable} Run sequences of 4 steady states at once using vector registers for (fused) filters that are {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Vectorizable}
</ul>

<p>The {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FilterPhaser} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.DataFlow} classes do not appear in either of
the previous lists because they are not currently utilized by the
compiler.

<p> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.RemoveDynamicRates} was an unsafe transormation converting all dynamic rates to rate 1.  It is superceded by use of {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRDynamicRateManager}.


<p> Some classes in this package are usually invoked from other passes.

<ul>
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Propagator} which performs constant propagation, copy propagation, and algebraic and boolean simplification is called from {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp}
<li> {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.FieldProp} and {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Unroller} are called as needed from {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.ConstantProp} for propagating parameters through the stream graph.
</ul>

<p> Some classes in this package are only used by the obsolete C library (uni) backend.  These include:
<ul>
<li>{@link Flattener}</li>
<li>{@link Structurer}</li>
<li>{@link SIRSchedule}</li>
<li>{@link SIRScheduler}</li>
<li>{@link LowerInitFunctions}</li>
<li>{@link LowerWorkFunctions}</li>
</ul>
{@link LoweringConstants} contains some constants unly used by the obsolete C library (uni) backend, and some constants used by other backends.
