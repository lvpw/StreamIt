<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion</title>
</head>
<body>


<p>
Provides compiler passes to fuse (combine) a set of filters into a
single filter.  Currently this transformation is applied for two
reasons:
<ul>
<li> To allow optimization across filter boundaries.  After being
fused into a single filter, optimizations such as constant propagation
(and scalar replacement) can improve buffer-management code.  See
Section 5 of this
<a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/05/sermulins-lctes05.pdf">LCTES'05</a>
paper for more details.
<p><li> To provide load-balancing on a distributed target.  If one
employs a simple runtime system that runs only one filter per
processor (for example, the space-multiplexing {@link
at.dms.kjc.raw.RawBackend}), then fusion is needed to map multiple
filters to that processor.
</ul>

<p>
The main fusion classes are {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion.FusePipe} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion.FuseSplit}, which apply to pipelines
and splitjoins, respectively.  (Fusion of feedback loops is not yet
implemented, though it should be straightforward to write.)  There are
two alternate implementations of pipeline fusion, as described in the
<a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/05/sermulins-lctes05.pdf">LCTES'05</a>
paper: one that uses modulo addressing ({@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion.ModuloPipelineFusion}) and one that
avoids modulo operations ({@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion.ShiftPipelineFusion}).  There is also
an optimized splitjoin fusion ({@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion.FuseSimpleSplit}) for certain cases of
splitjoins.

<p>The {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion.FuseAll} class can be
used to fuse everything in a hierarchical stream graph.  {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.fusion.Lifter} provides graph canonicalization
(removing pipeline wrappers, for example) that are sometimes produced
by fusion (as well as other transformations).
