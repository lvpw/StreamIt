/**
 * This visitor is for visiting stream structures in the SIR.  It
 * allows each visit to return an object for the caller to see.  It
 * does not visit statement-level constructs like SIRInitStatement,
 * SIRPushStatement, etc, nor (UNLIKE StreamVisitor) does it do the
 * recursing to component streams automatically.  
 *
 * The differences between this and StreamVisitor is that:
 *  
 *  1. Each method returns an object that can be used by the caller.
 *
 *  2. As a result of this, recursion is not automatic; you call the
 *     sub-visit methods if you want to visit one of them.
 *
 *  3. The recursion is done through the stream classes instead of
 *     through iterators.  Consequently, you don't get a reference
 *     to the parent in the visitor.
 *
 *  4. This visits splitters/joiners, whereas StreamVisitor only visits 
 *     streams.
