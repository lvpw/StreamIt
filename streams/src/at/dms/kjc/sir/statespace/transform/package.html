<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.statespace.transform</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Performs algebraic combination of adjacent linear statespace filters
in the stream graph.  As described in this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/05/agrawal-cases05.pdf">CASES'05
paper</a> and Sitij Agrawal's <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/04/sitij-meng-thesis.pdf">M.Eng. thesis</a>,
adjacent filters can be algebraically combined if they fit into the
linear statespace model.  As opposed to filter fusion, this
transformation statically evaluates the product of coefficients in the
two filters, and often changes the number of FLOPs required by the
overall computation.

<p>
The main classes performing the combinations are {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.transform.LinearTransformPipeline}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.transform.LinearTransformSplitJoin}, and
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.transform.LinearTransformFeedback}.

<p>
Because the linear statespace representation is a generalization of
the linear representation, the algebraic combination presented in this
package is a generalization of the passes in
<tt>at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.transform</tt>.  That is, this package
provides all the transformations of the linear package, and this
package also provides combination of feedback loops.  

<p>
However, there is some overhead dealing with filter states, and the
performance of statespace combination might be worse than plain linear
combination (even for plain linear filters).  Also, the code
generation rules for plain linear filters are more highly optimized
than the current statespace rules.  Thus, with our current
implementation, it is probably worthwhile to resort to plain linear
combination when it applies.
