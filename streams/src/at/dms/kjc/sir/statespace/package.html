<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.statespace</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Provides analysis and optimization of linear statespace portions of
the stream graph.  A <em>linear statespace</em> filter is just like a
linear filter, except that it may also contain a number of internal
states.  On each execution step, the filter outputs a linear
combination of its inputs and the states; furthermore, the states are
updated to be a linear combination of the inputs and the previous
states.

<p>
This package automatically detects linear statespace filters (or
<em>statespace</em> filters for short) by analyzing the code in their
work functions.  Statespace filters can be optimized in three ways:
first, by algebraically collapsing adjacent filters; second, by
minimizing the number of states; and third, by reducing the number of
system parameters.  All of these transformations can reduce the number
of FLOPs in the overall computation.  For the details of statespace
analysis, see this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/05/agrawal-cases05.pdf">CASES'05
paper</a> or Sitij Agrawal's <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/04/sitij-meng-thesis.pdf">M.Eng. thesis</a>.

<p>
The implementation of statespace analysis was based on that of linear
analysis (from the <tt>linear</tt> package).  The main classes
involved in the detection of statespace filters are {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.LinearAnalyzer} (which operates at the
stream level) and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.LinearFilterVisitor} (which operates inside
each work function).  The statespace representation itself is encapsulated
by {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.LinearFilterRepresentation}, which
uses {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.FilterMatrix} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.FilterVector}.

<p>
The implementation of algebraic combination is contained in a
sub-package: {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.transform.LinearTransformPipeline}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.transform.LinearTransformSplitJoin}, and
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.transform.LinearTransformFeedback}.
The state minimization and parameter reduction optimizations are
implemented in {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.LinearOptimizer},
while the {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.LinearDirectReplacer} class
provides the only code generation mechanism for statespace filters.

<p>
Unlike with plain linear optimizations, there does not yet exist a
partitioner that automatically determines which statespace
optimizations are the most profitable to apply to a given stream
graph.

<p>
Note that some files in this package may be complete vestigial
artifacts from copying over the <tt>linear</tt> package.  For example,
the {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.LinearRedundancyAnalyzer} and
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.statespace.LinearRedundancy} classes should be
ignored (they could be removed, if incidental dependences from other
files were taken care of).
