/**
 * This class represents an access expression for a field or array.
 * The field access expressions
 * provided by KOPI don't seem to do the right thing for equals -- eg they
 * implement strict object equality and I want them to use value equality.
 * (and I haven't tested the behavior of ArrayAccessExpressions, but I assume that
 * they also don't do the right thing for equals).
 * (eg two wrappers that
 * represent the same field should be equal).<br>
 *
 * As an interesting note on implementation in KOPI, it seems as though there are
 * two cases that we will accept as being valid "prefix" part of a JFieldAccessExpression.
 * The first is a JThisExpression if the field is a local field.
 * The second is a JLocalVariableExpression if the field is from a class
 * that is being used as a structure.<br>
 *
 * If the prefix is not one of the above things, then we give up and don't
 * wrap it.
 *
 * Also, we can wrap array accesses, but it gets tricky when combinations of
 * arrays and fields are used....<br>
 *
 * <H1>NOTE: I am not sure that the whole access wrapper thing actually works
 * This was too much of a reimplementation of ConstProp.
 * </H1>
