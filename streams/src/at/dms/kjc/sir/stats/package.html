<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.sir.stats</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Provides passes to gather statistics about stream programs, such as
parallelization potential and botteleneck work.

<p>
This package was written by Jeremy Wong as part of his M.Eng thesis,
<a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/04/wong-meng-thesis.pdf">Modeling
the Scalability of Acyclic Stream Programs</a>.  The harness that
calls this code is not completely integrated with the rest of the
source tree, so it may not be usable in its current form.  This code
also appears to depend on some minor adjustment of constants elsewhere
in the source tree (such as {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.WorkEstimate}) that were never
checked in.  Thus, it might not be possible to reproduce the numbers
reported in the thesis without consulting in Jeremy's home directory
on the MIT CAG server (grep for "jnwong" in the StreamIt
<tt>.java</tt> sources under
<tt>/u/jnwong/streams/src</tt>).
