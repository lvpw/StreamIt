<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.linear.frequency</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Translates linear filters into the frequency domain.  As described in
this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03
paper</a> and Andrew Lamb's <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/aalamb-meng-thesis.pdf">M.Eng. thesis</a>,
filters can be implemented in the frequency domain if each of their
outputs is an affine combination of their inputs.  This package
implements this transformation for linear filters by generating code
that performs an FFT, vector-vector multiply, and IFFT.  

<p>
Currently the {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.frequency.LEETFrequencyReplacer} is the main
class for this package.  It depends on some library hooks to implement
FFT and IFFT.  At the time of this writing, these hooks are available
only in the original uniprocessor C library.
