<p>
Provides analysis and optimization of linear portions of the stream
graph.  A filter is linear if each of its outputs is a known affine
combination of its inputs.  This package automatically detects such
filters by analyzing the code in their work functions.  Linear filters
can be optimized in two ways: first, by algebraically collapsing
adjacent filters, and second, by converting filters to the frequency
domain.  Both of these transformations can remove a significant number
of FLOPs from the overall computation.  For the details of linear
analysis, see this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03
paper</a> or Andrew Lamb's <a href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/aalamb-meng-thesis.pdf">M.Eng. thesis</a>.

<p>
The main classes involved in the detection of linear filters are
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.LinearAnalyzer} (which operates at the
stream level) and {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.LinearFilterVisitor}
(which operates inside each work function).  The linear representation
itself is encapsulated by {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.LinearFilterRepresentation}, which uses {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.FilterMatrix} and {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.FilterVector}.

<p>
Once linear filters are detected, adjacent filters can be combined and
simplified.  The implementation of algebraic combination is contained
in a sub-package: {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.transform.LinearTransformPipeline} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.transform.LinearTransformSplitJoin}.  

<p>
The classes ending with "Replacer" generate code for the linear
components.  There are several different code generation strategies
for the direct implementation of linear filters (as a matrix-vector
multiply); those implementations are contained in this directory.  One
can also implement linear filters in the frequency domain; this code
generation is done in the <tt>frequency</tt> sub-package.

<p>
Note that the best driver for linear optimizations is the {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.partition.linear.LinearPartitioner}, which
applies a dynamic programming algorithm to determine which
optimizations should be applied to various filters.
