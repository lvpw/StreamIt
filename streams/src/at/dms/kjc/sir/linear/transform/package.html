<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.linear.transform</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Performs algebraic combination of adjacent linear filters in the
stream graph.  As described in this <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/pldi-linear.pdf">PLDI'03
paper</a> and Andrew Lamb's <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/03/aalamb-meng-thesis.pdf">M.Eng. thesis</a>,
adjacent filters can be algebraically combined if each of their
outputs is an affine combination of their inputs.  As opposed to
filter fusion, this transformation statically evaluates the product of
coefficients in the two filters, and often changes the number of FLOPs
required by the overall computation.

<p>
The main classes performing the combinations are {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.transform.LinearTransformPipeline} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.linear.transform.LinearTransformSplitJoin}.  They
employ the rules described in the above papers.  Note that there are
no combination rules for feedback loops because it is impossible to
combine a feedback loop while maintaining a linear representation;
instead, a linear representation with <em>state</em> is needed.  This
combination is implemented by the statespace package (see below),
which is a generalization of linear combination but may introduce
extra overhead for simple linear filters.
