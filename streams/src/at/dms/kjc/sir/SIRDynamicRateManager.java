/**
 * This class governs how dynamic rates are interpreted at a given
 * point in the compiler.  The idea is that compiler passes sometimes
 * want to view dynamic rates in different ways -- for example,
 * treating a dynamic rate as a fixed constant, as an upper bound, or
 * as an exceptional case.  
 *
 * This class basically encapsulates a dynamic variable, which
 * indicates the current policy for interpreting dynamic rates
 * everywhere in the compiler.  The methods should be called (for
 * example) from the main backend passes to specify how all dynamic
 * rates should be interpreted for a given portion of the compiler.
 *
 * To make the calling convention more natural, the class exposes a
 * stack paradigm where a stack of policies is maintained.  The
 * top-most element of the stack is always used for interpreting
 * rates.  One can change the policy by pushing on a new policy, or by
 * popping off the old policy.
