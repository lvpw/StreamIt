<body>

<p>
Contains the heart of the StreamIt Intermediate Representation, or SIR
for short.  This intermediate representation exists at two levels:
<ul>

<li> The stream graph level, which captures the hierarchy and
connectivity of filters (for example, {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRPipeline}.

<li> The statement level, which extends Kopi's IR with statements and
expressions for StreamIt keywords.

</ul>

The stream graph is encapsulated in a structured hierarchy of
single-input, single-output modules.  At the base of this hierarchy is
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRFilter}, which represents the basic StreamIt
filter.  Filters are composed into hierarchical graphs using the
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRPipeline}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRSplitJoin}, and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRFeedbackLoop} classes.  There are also special kinds
of pre-defined filters, such as {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRFileReader}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRFileWriter}, and {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRIdentity}.

<p>
For statement-level StreamIt IR constructs, this package contains
classes such as {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRPushExpression}, {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRPopExpression}, and {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRPeekExpression} that reflect uses of those
expressions from within a filter's
<tt>work</tt> function.  There also exist some SIR statements that are
only for internal use by the compiler, and do not directly correspond
to a keyword in the language (such as {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRBeginMarker}, which tracks the beginning of a
filter's code through fusion events).

<p>
The other important component of the SIR are the stream-level
visitors.  These visitors descend through the hierarchical stream
graph and can be extended to perform an operation on each filter,
pipeline, etc.  The {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.StreamVisitor} interface
(implemented by {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.EmptyAttributeStreamVisitor})
performs the recursion automatically and has a return type of void
from each visit, while the {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.AttributeStreamVisitor} interface (implemented by
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.EmptyAttributeVisitor}) uses user-defined
recursion with return types from visits.

<p>
The hierarchical structure of the SIR is utilized by many optimization
passes (notably, all of those packages under the "sir" directory of
the source tree).  For certain backends (such as {@link
at.dms.kjc.raw.RawBackend} and {@link
at.dms.kjc.cluster.ClusterBackend}) the hierarchy of the stream graph
is eventaully eliminated to form a <em>flat</em> graph representation.

<p>
The rationale behind the hierarchy of the SIR is described in the
research paper, <a
href="http://cag.lcs.mit.edu/commit/papers/02/streamit-cc.pdf">StreamIt:
A Language for Streaming Applications</a>.
