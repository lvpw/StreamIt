<p>
Provides a set of low-level stubs (LIR stands for Low-level IR) for
compiling to the original (and mostly obsolete) uniprocessor backend.
This uniprocessor backend links against a C library implementation,
where each LIR node roughly corresponds to a library call.  The
library stores the information transmitted through the calls so that
it knows how to properly execute the stream graph.

<p>
The LIR nodes are meaningless outside the context of the original
uniprocessor backend.  The main file for this backend is {@link
at.dms.kjc.lir.LIRToC}.
