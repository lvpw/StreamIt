<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.flatgraph</title>
</head>
<body>
The flatgraph package contains classes to create and represent the SIR
graph in a flat format with no containers (thus no hierarchy or
structure).  The flat graph is intimately tied to the SIR
graph through the {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatNode#contents} and / or {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatNode#oldContents} fielde.
 The constructed graph of FlatNodes, the Flat graph, will havs
one node for each SIRFilter, SIRSplitter, and SIRJoiner in the SIR graph (except when --sync is
enabled), but there will exist no containers, FlatNodes directly
connect to/from their downstream/upstream nodes.
<p>
We create a graph of {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatNode} 
that represents the underlying SIR graph of the application using
{@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.GraphFlattener}
<p>
Each SIROperator will be converted to a FlatNode by GraphFlattener: SIRFilter into a
FlatNode with at most one input/one output, SIRSplitter into a
multiple output/one input, SIRJoiner into multiple input/one output.
<p>
If --sync is enabled, it will attempt to coalesce multiple splitters
or joiners into a single FlatNode.
<p>
Warning: In the presence of 0-weight edges in splitters or joiners,
there will not be a 1-1 correspondence between offsets in the weights
arrays of the spliiers and joiners and the nodes vector in a FlatNode.
Use the {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatWeights} to iterate if you need weight information
from a splitter / joiner anc corrresponding edge from a FlatNode.
