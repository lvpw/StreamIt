<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.flatgraph</title>
</head>
<body>
The flatgraph package contains classes to create and represent the SIR
graph in a flat format with no containers (thus no hierarchy or
structure).  Right now the flat graph is intimately tied to the SIR
graph. The constructed graph of FlatNodes, the Flat graph, will have
one node for each SIROperator in the SIR graph (except when --sync is
enabled), but there will exist no containers, FlatNodes directly
connect to/from their downstream/upstream nodes.
<p>
We create a graph of {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatNode} 
that represents the underlying SIR graph of the application using
{@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.GraphFlattener}
<p>
Each SIROperator will be converted to a FlatNode: SIRFilter into a
FlatNode with at most one input/one output, SIRSplitter into a
multiple output/one input, SIRJoiner into multiple input/one output.
<p>
If --sync is enabled, it will attempt to coalesce multiple splitters
or joiners into a single FlatNode.
