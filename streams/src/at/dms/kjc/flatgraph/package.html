<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.flatgraph</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>FlatNode basics</h2>
The flatgraph package contains classes to create and represent the SIR
graph in a flat format with no containers (thus no hierarchy or
structure).  The flat graph is intimately tied to the SIR
graph through the {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatNode#contents} and / or {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatNode#oldContents} fields.
 The constructed graph of {@link FlatNode}s, the "flat graph", will have
one node for each SIRFilter, SIRSplitter, and SIRJoiner in the SIR graph (except when <code>--sync</code> is
enabled), but there will exist no containers, {@link FlatNode}s directly
connect to/from their downstream/upstream nodes.
</p><p>
We create a graph of {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatNode}s
that represents the underlying SIR graph of the application using
{@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.GraphFlattener}
</p><p>
Each SIROperator will be converted to a FlatNode by GraphFlattener: SIRFilter into a
FlatNode with at most one input/one output, SIRSplitter into a
multiple output/one input, SIRJoiner into multiple input/one output.
</p><p>
If <code>--sync</code> is enabled, it will attempt to coalesce multiple splitters
or joiners into a single FlatNode.
</p><p>
Warning: In the presence of 0-weight edges in splitters or joiners,
there will not be a 1-1 correspondence between offsets in the weights
arrays of the splitters and joiners and the nodes vector in a FlatNode.
Use the {@link at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.FlatWeights} to iterate if you need weight information
from a splitter / joiner and corresponding edge from a FlatNode.
</p>
<h2>Static-Rate Stream Sub-Graphs</h2>
The {@link StreamGraph Stream Graph} is a graph of {@link StaticStreamGraph static-rate stream subgraph}s, "SSG"s.
Each SSG is a single-input, single-output graph represented internally as a graph of {@link FlatNode }s.
The Stream Graph is a graph of SSG's.
Any original dynamic-rate edges in the original SIR graph are removed from the SSGs: They are remembered as {@link SSGEdge}s.
A dynamic rate edge is expected to occur only between filters, but there is as yet no graph transformation to ensure that
this is the case.
Filters connecting to a dynamic edge are given I/O rates of 0 for that edge, and a input / output type of Void for that edge.
If there is more than one input (resp. output) filter with a disconnected from a dynamic edge, then the single input / single output 
property of the SSG is maintained by introducing a splitter (resp. joiner) with 0-weight edges.
</p><p>
Create a StreamGraph as</p><pre>
        StreamGraph streamGraph = new StreamGraph((new GraphFlattener(str)).top);
        streamGraph.createStaticStreamGraphs();
</pre>
<p>After using SSGs, you can recreate the SIR graph, or continue to use a FlatNode representation:</p><pre>
        str = streamGraph.recreateSIR();
        FlatNode strTop = streamGraph.getTopLevel().getTopLevel();
</pre>
<p>
There is a visitor interface defined to visit SSGs: {@link StreamGraph}.
There is a {@link ScheduledStaticStreamGraph} subclass of SSGs that will provide a map from FlatNode to Integer for a 
single-appearance schedule.  (It turns out that SIROperator to Integer would have been better since the setTopLevelSIR operation 
a SSG re-creates all the FlatNodes and thus invalidates any previous scheduling information.)
</p><p>
The advantage of SSGs is that scheduling and partitioning do not need to be enhanced to deal with dynamic-rate edges.
The disadvantage is in determining the quirks, and maintaining the SSG representation: it should eventually be discontinued
in favor of enhancing the scheduler and partitioners to deal with dynamic-rate edges.
