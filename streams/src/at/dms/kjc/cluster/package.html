<p>
The cluster backend for StreamIt generates
a set of threads that can be executed on a cluster of networked
computers or a SMP. For each splitter/joiner/filter (see {@link @SIROperator})
a threadX.cpp file is generated that contains code for the operator.
The threads are enumerated from 0 to N-1 (the mapping between 
operators and integers is maintained by the class {@link NodeEnumerator}).

<p>
A file master.cpp contains the master thread that is executed on
each cluster node and invokes appropriate operator threads.
File 'Makefile.cluster' contains instructions about compiling the
C files generated by the cluster backend.

<p>
The mapping between operator threads and cluster machines is
defined in 'cluster-config.txt' file. File 'cluster-setup.txt'
contains the number of steady state iterations the stream 
program should execute (Note that this can be overridden by passing
'-i N' parameter to the 'run_cluster'). 

<p>
After executing 'make -f Makefile.cluster' a 'run_cluster' executable
is generated. This executable should be invoked on all machines
defined in 'cluster-config.txt'.

<p>
The file 'cluster.h' defines the checkpointing freqency. By default
the checkpointing is turned off. Files 'global.h' and 'global.cpp' 
contain static fields of the stream program. File 'structs.h' 
contains structures defined by the stream program.


<h3>Cluster Standalone</h3>

Cluster backend also generates fusion.h and fusion.cpp files that
can be used to compile a single thread version of a stream program
for execution on a uniprocessor. The fusion.cpp contains a method
that invokes work functions of the operators from a single thread.

If -cluster option is cobined with -standalone then after executing
'make -f Makefile.cluster' a 'fusion' file will be generated instead
or 'run_cluster'.
