<p>
The cluster backend for streamit. The cluster backend generates
a set of threads that can be exeecuted on a cluster of networked
computers or a SMP. For each splitter/joiner/filter (see {@link @SIROperator})
a threadX.cpp file is generated that contains code for the operator.
The threads are enumerated from 0 to N-1. The mapping between 
operators and integers is maintained by the class {@link NodeEnumerator}.

<p>
A file master.cpp contains the master thread that is executed on
each cluster node and invokes appropriate operator threads.

<p>
The mapping between operator threads and cluster machines is
defined in 'cluster-config.txt' file. File 'cluster-setup.txt'
contains the number of steady state iterations the stream 
program should execute (Note that this can be overridden by passing
'-i N' parameter to the 'run_cluster'). 

<p>
The file 'cluster.h' defines the checkpointing freqency. By default
the checkpointing is turned off.

<p>
Files 'global.h' and 'global.cpp' contain static fields of the
stream program.

<p>
File 'structs.h' contains structures defined by the stream program.

<p>
File 'Makefile.cluster' contains instructions about compiling the
C files generated by the cluster backend.

<p>
After executing 'make -f Makefile.cluster' a 'run_cluster' executable
is generated. This executable should be invoked on all machines
defined in 'cluster-config.txt'.

<h2>Standalone</h2>

Cluster backend also generates fusion.h and fusion.cpp files that
can be used to compile a single thread version of a stream program
for execution on a uniprocessor. The fusion.cpp contains a method
that invokes work functions of the operators from a single thread.

If -cluster option is cobined with -standalone then after executing
'make -f Makefile.cluster' a 'fusion' file will be generated instead
or 'run_cluster'.
