<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.slicegraph</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
This package aims to supersede the SIR and flatgraph representations
of the stream graph with a single representation that maintains all
relevant information as well as slice information. 
The package contains the slice data structures, but omits manipulation
of the data structures in ways that are not general: in particular,
software pipelining algorithms from ASPLOS'06 are not in this package,
</p>
<p>Class notes for my edification:
<ul>
<li>
{@link at.dms.kjc.spacetime.Trace} is still in spacetime, and should
be moved.  It defines a collection of TraceNodes, started with an
InputTraceNode.
For people used to the SIR representation, a slice can be thought of
as a joiner (InputTraceNode), followed by a pipeline of filters
(FilterTraceNode), followed by a splitter (OutputTraceNode).
</li><li>
{@link TraceNode} abstract class with previous and next TraceNode's
(internal connections within a slice) and with a parent Trace. 
  <ul>
  <li> 
  {@link InputTraceNode} manages an array of Edge's: "sources"
  </li><li>
  {@link OutputTraceNode} manages an array of arrays of Edge's: "dests"
  </li><li>
  {@link FilterTraceNode} contains FilterContent.
  </li>
  </ul>
</li><li>
{@link Edge} class gives connection between slices (actually between an
InputTraceNode and an OutputTraceNode), and may be queried for type,
number of items sent on edge at init, at priming, and steady state
times.  TraceNode's within a slice are connected as a simple
doubly-linked list.  (Note that the priming information for an edge is
not calculated in the slicegraph package).

</li><li>
{@link FilterContent} keeps information about a filter, including init
and steady scheduling multiplicities, and information about linear
(but not linear statespace) filters.  You can construct a
FilterContent from a {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRPhasedFilter}, from a
{@link UnflatFilter} (including a linear one), or by shallow copy from
another {@link FilterContent}.  The subclass {@link PredefinedContent}
seems to exist only for "instanceof" 
  <ul>
  <li>
  {@link InputContent} has a single subclass {@link FileInputContent}
  which remembers a file name, can be constructed from a
  SIRFileReader. 
  </li><li>
  {@link OutputContent} has a single subclass {@link
  FileOutputContent} which remembers a file name, can be constructed
  from a SIRFileWriter, and allows a value to be set for expected
  number of outputs. 
  </li>
  </ul>
</li><li>
{@link FlattenGraph} takes a SIRStream, a linear analyzer, and what
appears to be init and steady state execution counts.  It performs the
linear analysis and synchronization removal.  It can be queried to get
top level {@link UnflatFilter}s.
<ul><li>
I have been told that FlattenGraph is soon to be obsoleted in favor of 
{@link SynchRemover}
</li></ul>
</li><li>
{@link SynchRemover} is not currently called from anywhere. Should be soon.
</li><li>
{@link Partitioner} is an abstract class defining the partitioning of
a graph to be an array of Trace's. It requires UnflatFilter's from
{@link FlattenGraph}, a schedule, linear analyzer, work estimate, and
a bound on the number of partitions to be created (which may be
ignored by any particular implementation).
A Partitioner can be queried for an array of {@link at.dms.kjc.spacetime.Trace} nodes. 
  <ul>
  <li>
  {@link FlattenAndPartition} is used by spacetime for 
  {@link at.dms.kjc.KjcOptions#nopartition}.  
  It uses old {at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.GraphFlattener} to flatten the
  graph, does not attempt synch removal, and partitions as one filter
  per slice.
  </li><li>
  {@link AdaptivePartitioner} is used by spacetime for {@link
  at.dms.kjc.KjcOptions#autoparams}.  It is undocumented, but
  apparently only works for 16-tile raw.  Mike says: probably obsolete
  after being used for some testing for the ASPLOS'06 paper.
  </li><li>
  {@link SimplePartitioner} is used by spacetime as the default partitioner.
  Each slice should be a pipeline of FilterTraceNode's stared with one
  InputTraceNode and ending with one OutputTraceNode. 
  </li>
  </ul>
</li><li>
{@link EdgeList} and {@link EdgeArray}, deal with structures of 
{@link UnflatEdge} which, along with {@link UnflatFilter} are used by 
{@link FlattenGraph}.  
The {@link UnflatFilter} contains a 
{@link at.dms.kjc.sir.SIRFilter}, which is presumably why it is "Unflat"
</li><li>
{@link PeekPopPushInHelper} determines whether any functions other
than the work function access the tape.  It operates on both
FilterContent and on SIRFilter. 
</li><li>
{@link DataFlowOrder} produces a list of Traces (Slices) in reverse
depth-first order.  It is referred to from a number of places in
spacetime, but not from elsewhere in slicegraph.  However, slicegraph
is a good place for this general utility on slices.
</li><li>
{@link IntList} primitive list implementation used in {@link
FlattenGraph}.
</li><li>
<!-- {@link IntArrayList} is unused and should be removed.</li><li> -->
{@link Util} contains utility routines for the slice graph.
</li>
</ul>

TODO: update when SynchRemover in place!
