/**
 * This class represents the entire stream graph of the application we are
 * compiling. It is composed of StaticStreamGraphs in which all filters
 * communicate over static rate channels. The connections between
 * StaticStreamGraphs (SSGs) are dynamic rate.
 * 
 * The StreamGraph includes objects (passes) that operate on it and store
 * information for compilation, such as layout, FileState, etc.
 * 
 * This extension to at.dms.kjc.flatgraph.StreamGraph is to allow layout
 * and scheduling information to be associated with a StreamGraph and its
 * associated StatisStreamGraph's
 * 
 * It is a bit confusing casting something which already appears to be
 * of type StreamGraph to StreamGraph, wh should have had different names.
