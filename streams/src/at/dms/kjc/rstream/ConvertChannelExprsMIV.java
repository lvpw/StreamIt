/**
 * This class will try to convert the communication expressions of a filter
 * (push, pop, and peek) into buffer accesses that are indexed by a linear function
 * of the expression's enclosing loop indcution variables (MIVs).  It performs the conversion
 * inplace. 
 *
 * It handles pop/peek separately.  It will succeed for pops/peeks if all pops are 
 * enclosed only in analyzable control flow, which is incrementing doloops with static bounds or
 * if/then/else statements and the rate on each branch of an if are equal.
 *
 * Push statements are complementary.
