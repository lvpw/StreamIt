<title>Package documentation for at.dms.kjc.vanillaSlice</title>
<body>
<p>
This package was written to provide a test for the classes in {@link backendSupport}.
</p>
<p>
This package currently supports compiling to a uniprocessor.
But it is planed to extend this package to compile for a shared memory 
multiprocessor.
</p>
<pre>strc -newSimple N XXX.str</pre>
<p>where <code>N</code> is the number of processors to use in a shared memory 
multiprocessor, and defaults to <code>1</code> if not specified.
This number is actually just the number of threads to create and could
be set to more than the number of processors if necessary for good
load balancing.
</p>
<p>
When {@link at.dms.kjc.backendSupport} supports all the compiler
features currently supported by the <code>--cluster 1 --standalone</code>, 
then it is proposed that the <code>strc</code> switch name be changed
to <code>uni</code>.
</p>
<h3>Current shortcomings of this package: </h3>
<p>Any unimplemented compiler features inherited from 
{@link at.dms.kjc.backendSupport}
</p>
<p>We still need to complete implementation of shared memory multi-cores
/ shared memory multiprocessors:
If >1 processor specified then need to create a (p)thread per
processor and add code to start the (p)threads at the beginning.
</p>
<p>There are a few possible schemes for distributing code between
threads, none implemented yet:</p>
<p>All the following can run with double (multi) buffering and blocking:
Block producer on all buffers full, 
block consumer on all buffers empty,
A thread should be awake when all of the consumers of its output 
have at least one empty buffer available and 
all of its producers of data that it consumes have filled at least one
buffer.  
(The above allows bounding buffer sizes when there is a static
schedule.</p>
<ol>
<li>Software pipelining: each thread takes all stateless filters at
different steady states.  Stateful filters are somehow divided up.
One copy of code for each filter exists and is called form each thread.
</li>
<li>Space multiplexing: each thread takes a subgraph (not necessarily
a connected subgraph).  The CodeStore can inline the filter work
functions since a filter will only appear once in a thread.
(The existing Uniprocessor implementation does this inlining but does not
generate threads.)
</li>
<li>If all filters except I/O are data parallel, then each thread can
run in parallel with special threads assigned for I/O. (once again
call shared filter code).
</li>
</ol>
<p>A back end for a COW (cluster of workstations) is proposed.
This will present a challenge to the idea of "one compute node - one
code store" since each node in the cluster may be a multi-core
assembling code for multiple threads.
</p><p>
If can work out issues with code stores, it is proposed that each
machine in the cluster be responsible for some group of threads, but
now need socket communication and some degree of asynchrony between
the machines in the cluster.</p>
<p>Janis' original cluster implementation, giving a separate thread to
such filter, splitter, joiner had some problems with undiagnosable hangs.
