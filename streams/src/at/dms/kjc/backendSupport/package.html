<title>Package documentation for at.dms.kjc.backendSupport</title>

<h1>Package documentation for at.dms.kjc.backendSupport</h1>
<p>
For information about using the classes in this package for adding a
new back end, please see 
<a href="../../../../doc/implementation-notes/adding-a-backend.html">adding-a-backend</a>. 
</p><p>
The backendSupport package was refactored from the 
<a href="../spacetime/package.html">spacetime</a> back end. 
</p><p>
Back end support has several phases:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Standard transformations and optimizations:<br/>
{@link CommonPasses} takes the data passed to the back end from 
{@link at.dms.kjc.StreaMITMain StreaMITMain}, performs a standard
suite of optimizations on the {@link at.dms.kjc.sir stream graph}
(see {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering}), 
and converts to an unstructured graph format (see 
{@link at.dms.kjc.slicegraph}.
</p>
<p>
If you have a new optimization, the place to put it is usually in
<code>CommonPasses</code> so that it is available for all back ends. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Laying out code on your collection of processors:<br/>
This package supplies several methods of performing layout:
a greedy method {@link  BasicGreedyLayout} and a method using
simulated annealing {@link NoSWPipeLayout}.
Both methods assume that there is an estimate of work per filter.
So far, we only have work estimates for the raw processor.
Both methods assume that all processors are interchangeable.
If this is not the case, it is not too difficult to subclass 
{@link NoSWPipeLayout}.  ({@link  BasicGreedyLayout} needs to be
enhanced to support limiting the placement of a filter to a particular
subset of the processors.)
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lowering to Kopi code:<br/>
This is where most of the code in this package is used.
See
<a href="../../../../doc/implementation-notes/adding-a-backend.html">adding-a-backend</a>
for description of steps.
</p>
<p>
The code for each filter has its <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>,
and <code>peek</code> expressions replaced with calls to communication
code stored in {@link Channel}s.  The code for filters, and generated
code for splitters and joiners is stored in {@link ComputeCodeStore}s.
{@link ProcessFilterSliceNode} handles the translation of filters and
storing code into {@link ComputeCodeStore}s;
{@link CodeStoreHelperSimple} wraps the translated code with
scheduling code (including some scheduling action on channels).
Similarly, {@link ProcessInputSliceNode} and 
{@link CodeStoreHelperJoiner} create code for, and wrap scheduling
code for {@link at.dms.kjc.slicenode.InputSliceNode}s.
{@link ProcessOutputliceNode} and 
{@link CodeStoreHelperSplitter} create code for, and wrap scheduling
code for {@link at.dms.kjc.slicenode.OutputSliceNode}s.
These classes have some predefined extension points, and can be
sub-classed as needed.
</p>
<p>
Sub-class {@link BackEndFactory} to define your processor type
(subclassing {@link ComputeNode}), your system as a whole
(implementing {@link ComputeNodesI} or subclassing {@link ComputeNodes}).
You can add extra bits of code generation to a subclass of 
{@link ProcessFilterSliceNode} etc. for general extension, or add
processor-specific bits of code generation to a subclass of 
{@link ComputeCodeStore}.
All of the subclasses can be assembled in a way in which they can
reference each other by subclassing {@link BackEndFactory}.
</p>
<p>
{@link BackEndScaffold} contains the routines to drive the generation
of Kopi code for each SliceNode.
It drives the {@link ProcessFilterSliceNode} code etc. based on a
schedule {@link SpaceTimeScheduleAndPartitioner}.
The schedule has three phases, enumerated in {@link SchedulingPhase}.
Both the INIT and PRIMEPUMP phases generate code into the
initialization portion of a  {@link ComputeCodeStore}.  The STEADY
phase generates code into the steady-state portion of a 
{@link ComputeCodeStore}.
(There is also a cleanup portion of a {@link ComputeCodeStore} that is
currently used only for closing {@link at.dms.kjc.sir.FileWriter}s.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>{@link EmitCode} creates C code from the Kopi code contained in the
ComputeCodeStores and the Channels.
Since each processor type seems to require a slightly different top-level
<code>main</code> function, there is no provided top-level 
<code>main</code>.
</p>
<p>
{@link EmitTypedefs} will create some C code that is commonly stored
in a <code>.h</code> file. You will probably want to use some
additional code to package whatever else you need into the <code>.h</code> file
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Channels</h2>
<p>
{@link Channel} has many subclasses.
</p>
<p>
{@link GetOrMakeChannel} should be subclassed to create channels of
the appropriate subclass of {@link Channel}.
It defaults to using arrays to implement channels, which should work
for intra-processor communication.  You will probably want to override
{@link GetOrMakeChannel#makeInterSliceChannel(InterSliceEdge) makeInterSliceChannel}
to handle inter-processor communication.
</p>
<p>The following subclasses of channel are implemented for
intra-processor communication</p>
<ul>
<li>
{@link UnbufferredPopChannel} and {@link UnbufferredPushChannel} have
no underlying data structure and are used to communicate directly
between filter code and joiner (resp. splitter) code.</li>
<li>{@link DelegatingChannel} has no underlying data structure and is
used for trivial splitters and joiners to pass requests for action on
a channel directly to the channel implementing the InterSliceEdge.</li> 
<li>{@link ChannelAsArray} provides an array implementation of a
buffer that is completely filled by the producer and completely
emptied by the consumer.</li>
<li>{@link ChannelAsCircularArray} provides an implementation as a
circular array of size 2^n that may contain residual data between one
execution of the consumer and the next.</li>
<li>There is no implementation yet that is suitable for large
structures or arrays over channels when there is residual data between one
execution of the consumer and the next. 
In this case, rounding up to a power of 2 may cause excessive space use.</li>
<li>{@link BufferSize} is used to determine the minimum size for array
implementations of channels.</li>
</ul>
<p>Passing arrays over channels is a nuisance when it comes to
generating working and efficient C code, since C has inadequate
support for array dimensions.  One idea for fixing this is to use
{@link Channel#assignFromPeekMethod()} and {@link Channel#assignFromPopMethod()}
to copy arrays directly into local variables.  

NB: this needs support in the channel implementations and in {@link EmitCode}.
