<h2>Package Specification.</h2>
<p>
Provides a facility for iterating over the SIR structures that make up
a StreamIt program after <code>at.dms.kjc.Kopi2SIR</code> has been
run.  These iterators were created to serve to primary functions:
<ul>

<li> To serve as an interface to the StreamIt scheduler, which does
not know about internal SIR nodes.

<li> To allow for automatic memoization of nodes in the stream graph.

</ul>

<p>Of these two intentions, only the first one is currently utilized.
The classes in this package implement the iterator interfaces defined
by the scheduler, and thus serve as a primary contact between the
compiler and the scheduler.  However, the memoization procedure (see
{@link at.dms.kjc.iterator.Memoizer}) has been <em>deprecated</em>.
</p>
<p>Apart from interfacing with the scheduler, there is no particular
reason to use iterators for traversing the stream graph.  It is
equally viable to perform manual recursion through the stream
hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
The package should support all <code>SIRStream</code> constructs in
the program. Support is included for <code>SIRFilter</code>,
<code>SIRPhasedFilter</code>,  <code>SIRPipeline</code>, 
<code>SIRSplitJoin</code>, <code>SIRFeedbackLoop</code>, and
<code>SIRRecursiveStub</code>.
The package currently does not iterate over <code>SIRGlobal</code>s
since they are not reachable from the root of the program.
</p>
<p>
The basis for using the iterator package <code>IterFactory</code> is
something like:
</p>
<pre>
SIRStream sir = ...;
StreamVisitor lowLevelVisitor = new EmptyStreamVisitor();
IterFactory.createFactory().createIter(str).accept(lowLevelVisitor);
</pre>
<p>
The iterators created by <code>IterFactory</code> have certain useful
methods: finding the <code>SIRStream</code> object currently being
iterated over, finding its parent, determining its type, finding some
parameters of the object, etc.
<code>StreamVisitor</code> (and its subclasses) pass the iterator to the
visiting methods, and 
</p>
<p>
One common debugging idiom for dumping program contents is:
</p>
<pre>
SIRPrinter printer1 = new SIRPrinter("after munging:");
IterFactory.createFactory().createIter(str).accept(printer1);
printer1.close();
</pre>
<p>
(Another debugging idiom is to use <code>SIRToStreamIt</code>.)
