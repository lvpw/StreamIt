<title>Overview of at.dms.kjc.linprog</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
Provides a programmatic interface to various linear programming
solvers.  The main solvers available are {@link
at.dms.kjc.linprog.CPLEXSolve}, {@link at.dms.kjc.linprog.GLPKSolve},
and {@link at.dms.kjc.linprog.LPSolve}.  The {@link
at.dms.kjc.linprog.MPSWriter} class provides a way to write a linear
program to an MPS file (the standard format for linear programming),
thereby providing compatibility with a variety of additional solvers.

<p>
Of the solvers, the CPLEX solver is likely the fastest, though it
requires a commercial installation (available on <tt>cagfarm-40</tt>
for MIT CAG users).  As this machine is under batch processing
control, the {@link at.dms.kjc.linprog.CPLEXServer} class provides an
interface to invoke CPLEX from another machine using Java RMI.
