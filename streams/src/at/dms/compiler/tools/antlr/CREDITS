This program is derived from ANTLR 2.7.1, and has been adapted to the
special needs of the Kopi Project. Features available in the original
version of ANTLR which are not used by Kopi, such as automatic AST
generation or backends for C++ and Sather have been (partly) removed.

If you are looking for a parser generator you should use the original
version of ANTLR. You can find the latest original (and full) version
of ANTLR at http://www.ANTLR.org.

Here is the original license of ANTLR. Please note that our
version distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation See the
file COPYING in this directory for more details.

SOFTWARE RIGHTS

ANTLR 1989-2000 Developed by jGuru.com (MageLang Institute), 
http://www.ANTLR.org  and http://www.jGuru.com

We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the public
domain. An individual or company may do whatever they wish with source
code distributed with ANTLR or the code generated by ANTLR, including
the incorporation of ANTLR, or its output, into commerical software.

We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However, we do ask
that credit is given to us for developing ANTLR. By "credit", we mean
that if you use ANTLR or incorporate any source code into one of your
programs (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that you
acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation, research report,
etc... If you like ANTLR and have developed a nice tool with the
output, please mention that you developed it using ANTLR. In addition,
we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as
these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system
and expect to make other tools available as they are completed.
