    <p>
Core nodes for the STAIR intermediate representation.  This package
defines a set of nodes that together make up the intermediate
representation.  On their own, these classes are not enough to
represent a program; code is specialized for a particular target
machine, beginning with the STAIR VM.
    </p>
    <p>
Fundamentally, a program in STAIR consists of a series of {@link
streamit.stair.core.Instruction}s.  Each instruction has an {@link
streamit.stair.core.Opcode}, along with lists of source and
destination {@link streamit.stair.core.Operand}s.  The
<code>Opcode</code> defines the instruction format and the valid
operands.  Instructions are then grouped into {@link
streamit.stair.core.Block}s, which along with {@link
streamit.stair.core.ControlEdge}s make up a (possibly trivial)
control-flow graph.  The code for a function or similar region is
stored in a {@link streamit.stair.core.BlockContainer}.
