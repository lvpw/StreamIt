/**
 * Part of a control-flow graph containing an ordered sequence of
 * instructions.  This may be used to implement a basic block, or for
 * a flattened block containing an entire function's code, or
 * something in between.  Blocks are connected to each other with
 * {@link ControlEdge}s.  They also have sets of operands with
 * associated SSA information that are live on entry and exit of the
 * block.
 *
 * <p> This class also includes static methods for updating regions of
 * control-flow graphs.  These include methods for converting between
 * flat blocks and basic blocks and methods for updating per-block
 * information such as variable liveness.  These methods go here since
 * <code>BlockContainer</code> is an interface, since various
 * higher-level constructs might want to be block containers.
