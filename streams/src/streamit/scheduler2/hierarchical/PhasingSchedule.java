/**
 * This class stores all information about PhasingSchedules.
 * Phasing schedules basically are schedules that have sub-schedules.
 * Here, a phasing schedule will either have multiple sub-schedules
 * (sub phasing-schedules), or it will have a single Schedule.
 * 
 * Due to lack of multiple inheritance in Java, I am forced to 
 * implement new functionality by splitting each new object
 * into an algorithm and "shell" implementation.  Algorithms
 * provide the common functionality for new object.  "shell" object
 * simply call algorithm objects to perform appropriate operations.
 * This is silly, and is a consequence of Java constraining the
 * programmer so s/he can't shoot him self in the foot.  Good
 * programmers feel handcuffed, and bad programmers continue coming
 * up with new creative ways to shoot themselves in the foot.
