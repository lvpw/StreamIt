<title>Overview of streamit.scheduler2.singleappearance</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
This is the simplest scheduler we have. The idea behind this scheduler
is that for each phase of a stream will only contain a single instance
of execution of a child. This execution of the child will execute
enough steady states of it in order to guarantee that the parent will
end up executing a full steady state

<p>
There is one exception of this single-appearance principle here.
FeedbackLoop may need to insert several instances of its children.
This is an attempt to allow this scheduler to schedule more programs.
