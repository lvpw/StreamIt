<title>Overview of streamit.scheduler2.minlatency</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
This scheduler implements a minlatency scheduler, as described
in my (Michal Karczmarek) Master's Thesis.

<p>
A minlatency schedule is one which, for every phase, consumes only
as much data as is necessary to produce an output. One useful property
of such a schedule is that as long as a program has a legal schedule,
this scheduler will be able to find it.
