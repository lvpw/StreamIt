<title>Overview of streamit.scheduler2.constrained</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
This package was meant to provide a scheduler for programs constrained
by messaging. Unfortunately it was never finished, and for the most part
has little value.

<p>
The only useful (functional) part of this package is the SDEP computation.
This is provided through LatencyEdge, LatencyGraph and LatencyNode classes.
These classes are a library and do not depend on the rest of this package.
However, access to these classes is provided through the standard scheduler
interface using IR iterators, so much of the code here is actually
necessary.

<p>
The SDEP computation library is designed to work for arbitrary graphs of
streaming computation, not just structured graphs that StreamIt currently
uses. However, in discussion with Bill, we recently realized that the
algorithm here can fail in certain corner cases of unstructured graphs
involving loops. If non-structured graphs are ever to be used in this
library, the computation of SDEP algorithm may need to be rewritten.
