    <p>
Assorted passes on the StreamIt front-end IR.  These passes generally
are visitor classes on the front-end IR that replace parts of the IR
tree with other parts.  Thus, a class will typically extend {@link
streamit.frontend.nodes.FEReplacer}; {@link
streamit.frontend.passes.SymbolTableVisitor} is derived from this and
maintains an active {@link streamit.frontend.nodes.SymbolTable} within
each visitor function.
