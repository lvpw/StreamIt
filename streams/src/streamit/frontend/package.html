    <title>Overview of streamit.frontend</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
High-level code for the StreamIt frontend.  This package contains the
main entry points to the StreamIt frontend, along with the
ANTLR-generated scanner and parser for the language.  {@link
streamit.frontend.ToJava} is a top-level class that is run by the user
to convert StreamIt code to Java, suitable for use by the compiler;
{@link streamit.frontend.ToKopi} converts into the SIR representation
directly and runs the uniprocessor {@link
at.dms.kjc.sir.lowering.Flattener} sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
The scanner, {@link streamit.frontend.StreamItLex}, and parser,
{@link streamit.frontend.StreamItParserFE}, are both defined
here.  The Java files are actually generated by <a
href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> from the corresponding
<tt>.g</tt> files, so the Javadocs here are likely incomplete.
