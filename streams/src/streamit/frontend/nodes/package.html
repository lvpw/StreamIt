    <p>
Intermediate representation nodes for the StreamIt frontend.  This
package contains a high-level representation of a StreamIt program.
Nodes in this package are generated by {@link
streamit.frontend.StreamItParserFE}.  An entire program is stored in a
{@link streamit.frontend.nodes.Program} object, which contains a list
of {@link streamit.frontend.nodes.StreamSpec} objects.  Each of these
objects in turn contains the actual code making up the StreamIt
program.
    </p>
    <p>
By and large, the IR objects here are immutable.  The {@link
streamit.frontend.nodes.FEVisitor} class implements the <i>visitor</i>
pattern, which trades class polymorphism for method polymorphism.
(See <i>Design Patterns</i> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides.)
Thus, most classes in this package have an <code>accept</code> method,
which accepts a visitor object and calls the appropriate method on it.
