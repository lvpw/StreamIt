    <p>
Helper classes for converting StreamIt code to Java.  These classes
are used by conversion classes like
<code>streamit.frontend.ToJava</code> to convert the code.  {@link
streamit.frontend.tojava.NodesToJava} takes an IR tree and produces a
Java source file from it; this is the last stage in conversion.
