<body>

<p>
The main library package. Provides a Java-based framework for
executing programs without running them through the streamit
compiler. This is very useful for debugging programs, as well as
experimenting with new features of the language.

<p>
Random Notes:

<ul>
<li>
All classes are derrived from {@link streamit.misc.DestroyedClass}.
This is a left-over feature from my times of experimenting with
C++ -style destructors. I don't think this is used anywhere.
