/**
 * This class implements a filter with a dynamic peek rate. 
 * 
 * The implementation was based on the old (removed from CVS)
 * PhasedFilter implementation. The real work function is repeatedly
 * run in a separate thread which blocks whenever more input data is
 * needed. This essentially tries to implement a pull model on top of
 * JCC's push model, which may not be a good idea.
 * 
 * Because JCC expects everything to be run in the same vat thread, the worker
 * thread blocks whenever a data item is output. The vat thread picks up the
 * item and does the push. This costs 2 thread switches for every new item
 * input/output.
