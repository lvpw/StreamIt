SETTING UP STREAMIT ON CSAIL

1. Login to the machine you wish to use for development
- This can be the CSAIL machines (login.csail.mit.edu) or any other linux machine with java 1.6+.

2. Choose a directory for the repository and change directory to it 
- From now on @HOME@ represents this directory
- Note: the checkout will create a "streamit" directory in @HOME@


3. Checkout StreamIt source tree

- Type at prompt:
svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.csail.mit.edu/afs/csail.mit.edu/group/commit/reps/projects/streamit

4. Setup environment variables

- For csh derivatives open ~/.cshrc and add the following lines:

 setenv STREAMIT_HOMsE @HOME@/streamit/trunk/streams
 source ${STREAMIT_HOME}/include/dot-cshrc

- For bash derivatives open ~/.bashrc and add the following lines:
 
 export STREAMIT_HOME=@HOME@/streamit/trunk/streams
 source ${STREAMIT_HOME}/include/dot-bashrc

(Remember that @HOME@ is not a variable that we defined, but the fully-qualified parent directory 
that contains the repository.)

- Reload your environment variables:

 source ~/.cshrc 
or 
 source ~/.bashrc


5. Build the StreamIt compiler

 cd ${STREAMIT_HOME}/trunk/streams
 make

6. Test the compiler

- Compile a simple example:

 cd apps/examples/cookbook/
 strc Minimal.str
 ./a.out -i 10

 This should print an increasing stream of numbers from 1 to 10.

- View the stream graph for the application:

 dotty stream-graph.dot

7. Play around

- View other stream graphs generated during compile (*.dot)
- Modify the code in Minimal.str and see what happens
- Try compiling the other *.str files in that directory
- Try compiling with other options (strc -help)
- Inspect the generated code (combined_threads.cpp)
- Work through the StreamIt cookbook:
 http://cag.csail.mit.edu/streamit/papers/streamit-cookbook.pdf

8. For compiler hackers, optionally setup compiler source code in Eclipse:

- From your CSAIL login, do:
 cd $STREAMIT_HOME/docs/streamit_java_in_eclipse
 make

- Then find the latest instructions in streamit_java_in_eclipse.pdf
