SETTING UP STREAMIT ON CSAIL

1. Login to the machine you wish to use for development
-This can be the CSAIL machines (login.csail.mit.edu) or any other linux machine with java 1.6+.

2. Choose a directory for the repository and change directory to it 
Note: the checkout will create a "streams" directory in the current directory.

3. Checkout StreamIt source tree

- Type at prompt:
svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.csail.mit.edu/afs/csail.mit.edu/group/commit/reps/projects/streamit/streams

4. Setup environment variables

- For csh derivatives open ~/.cshrc (or .bashrc) and add the following lines:

 setenv STREAMIT_HOME ${HOME}/streams/trunk/streams
 source {$STREAMIT_HOME}/include/dot-cshrc



- Reload your environment variables:

 source ~/.cshrc

5. Build the StreamIt compiler

 cd streams
 make

6. Test the compiler

- Compile a simple example:

 cd apps/examples/cookbook/
 strc Minimal.str
 ./a.out -i 10

 This should print an increasing stream of numbers from 1 to 10.

- View the stream graph for the application:

 mg stream-graph.dot
 OR
 dotty stream-graph.dot

7. Play around

- View other stream graphs generated during compile (*.dot)
- Modify the code in Minimal.str and see what happens
- Try compiling the other *.str files in that directory
- Try compiling with other options (strc -help)
- Inspect the generated code (combined_threads.cpp)
- Work through the StreamIt cookbook:
 http://cag.csail.mit.edu/streamit/papers/streamit-cookbook.pdf

8. For compiler hackers, optionally setup compiler source code in Eclipse:

- From your CAG login, do:
 cd $STREAMIT_HOME/docs/streamit_java_in_eclipse
 make

- Then find the latest instructions in streamit_java_in_eclipse.pdf
