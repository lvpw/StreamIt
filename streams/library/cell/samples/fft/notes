The FFT code is taken from asplos06/fft and hand-coded for the library.

static_fused has the FFT stream graph fused into a single data-parallel
filter which is run on all SPEs.

static_pipeline fuses the FFT stream graph into a pipeline of 6 filters
which are statically placed on different SPEs. Communication is done
directly between SPE local stores.

dynamic_pipeline runs the FFT stream graph unchanged using the dynamic
scheduler.

dynamic_fused runs the fused filter (same as static_fused) using the
dynamic scheduler.

To compile the dynamic versions, the dynamic scheduler sources first
need to be copied or linked into the directory.

The input and output directories contain data for 10,000 iterations, in
big-endian format for Cell.
