This is the mpeg2 benchmark from asplos06 (BlockDecode and
MotionVectorDecode streams of MPEG-2 decoder).

The static directory contains a static coarse-grained software-pipelined
schedule for 5 SPEs. Work profiling and partitioning were done manually;
there is a slight work imbalance but it is not major.

The dynamic directory uses the dynamic scheduler. To compile this,
the dynamic scheduler sources first need to be copied or linked into
the directory.

Both implementations use the same pair of filters generated by the
Cell backend as of 09/14/2007. There is one fused stateless filter
(filter1.c) and one fused stateful filter (filter2.c) as the two branches
of a splitjoin. The splitter and joiner are treated as additional
stateless filters for a total of four.

The input and output directories contain data taken from asplos06,
converted to big-endian format for Cell. This corresponds to 1320
iterations.
