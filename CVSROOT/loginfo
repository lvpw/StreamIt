#
# The "loginfo" file is used to control where "cvs commit" log information
# is sent.  The first entry on a line is a regular expression which is tested
# against the directory that the change is being made to, relative to the
# $CVSROOT.  For the first match that is found, then the remainder of the
# line is a filter program that should expect log information on its standard
# input.
#
# If the repository name does not match any of the regular expressions in the
# first field of this file, the "DEFAULT" line is used, if it is specified.
#
# If the name "ALL" appears as a regular expression it is always used
# in addition to the first matching regex or "DEFAULT".
#
# The filter program may use one and only one "%s" modifier (ala printf).  If
# such a "%s" is specified in the filter program, a brief title is included
# (as one argument, enclosed in single quotes) showing the relative directory
# name and listing the modified file names.
#
# NOTE: contrib/log usage:  (currently requires perl)
#	-d		- turn debugging on....
#	-m mailto	- send mail to "mailto" (multiple -m's permitted)
#	-f logfile	- required arg:  save messages to logfile
#	%s		- may follow other options at the end of the line
#
# NOTE: contrib/log_accum usage:  (currently requires perl)
# (must have 'commit_prep -r' in commitinfo)
#	-d		- turn debugging on....
#	-M modulename	- use this as the module name (necessary for sub-dirs)
#	-m mailto	- send mail to "mailto" (multiple -m's permitted) [optional]
#	-f logfile	- save messages to logfile [optional]
#	%s		- must follow other options at the end of the line
#
# without perl you could do this:
#DEFAULT		(echo ""; who am i; date; cat) >> $CVSROOT/CVSROOT/commitlog
